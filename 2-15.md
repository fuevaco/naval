# Choosing to Build Yourself

選擇打造自己

The greatest superpower is the ability to change yourself.

最偉大的超能力是改變自己的能力。

What』s the biggest mistake you』ve made in your life and how did you recover?
你一生中犯過的最大的錯誤是什麼？你是如何恢復過來的？
I』ve made a class of mistakes I would summarize the same way. The mistakes were obvious only in hindsight through one exercise, which is asking yourself: when you』re thirty, what advice would you give your twenty -year -old self? And when you』re forty, what advice would you give your thirty -year -old self? (Maybe if you』re younger, you can do it by every five years.) Sit down and say, 「Okay, 2007, what was I doing? How was I feeling? 2008, what was I doing? How was I feeling? 2009, what was I doing? How was I feeling?」

我犯了一類錯誤，我會用同樣的方式來總結。這些錯誤只有在事後通過一個練習才明顯，那就是問問你自己：當你30歲的時候，你會給20歲的自己什麼建議？當你四十歲的時候，你會給三十歲的自己什麼建議呢？(也許如果你年輕一點，你可以每五年做一次。)坐下來說，「好吧，2007年，我在做什麼？我當時感覺如何？2008年，我在做什麼？我當時感覺如何？2009年，我在做什麼？我當時感覺如何？「
Life is going to play out the way it』s going to play out. There will be some good and some bad. Most of it is actually just up to your interpretation. You』re born, you have a set of sensory experiences, and then you die. How you choose to interpret those experiences is up to you, and different people interpret them in different ways.

生活將會按照它將要進行的方式進行。會有一些好的，也有一些不好的。實際上，大部分都取決於你的解釋。你出生了，你有一系列的感官體驗，然後你就死了。你如何選擇解釋這些經歷取決於你，不同的人會用不同的方式來解釋它們。

Really, I wish I had done all of the same things, but with less emotion and less anger. The most celebrated example would be when I was younger, I started a company. This company did well, but I didn』t do well, so I sued some of the people involved. It was a good outcome for me in the end, and everything worked out okay, but there was a lot of angst and a lot of anger.

真的，我希望我做了所有同樣的事情，但是少一些情緒，少一些憤怒。最著名的例子是在我年輕的時候，我開了一家公司。這家公司做得很好，但我做得不好，所以我起訴了一些涉案人員。最終這對我來說是個好結果，一切都很順利，但也有很多焦慮和憤怒。

Today, I wouldn』t have the angst and the anger. I would have just walked up to the people and said, 「Look, this is what happened. This is what I』m going to do. This is how I』m going to do it. This is what』s fair. This is what』s not.」

今天，我就不會有焦慮和憤怒了。我會走到人們面前說，「看，這就是發生的事情。這就是我要做的。這就是我要怎麼做的。這才是公平的。這不是事實。「
I would have realized the anger and emotions are a huge, completely unnecessary consequence. Now, I』m trying to learn from that and do the same things I think are the right things to do but without anger and with a very long -term point of view. If you take a very long -term point of view and take the emotion out of it, I wouldn』t consider those things mistakes anymore. [4]

我會意識到憤怒和情緒是一個巨大的，完全不必要的後果。現在，我正試圖從中吸取教訓，做我認為正確的事情，但不要生氣，要有非常長遠的觀點。如果你從一個非常長遠的角度來看，把情感從其中剔除，我就不會再認為這些事情是錯誤的。

Again, habits are everything—everything we are. We are trained in habits from when we are children, including potty training, when to cry and when not to, how to smile and when not to. These things become habits—behaviors we learn and integrate into ourselves.

再說一次，習慣決定一切--我們的一切。我們從小就被訓練成習慣，包括如廁訓練，什麼時候哭什麼時候不哭，什麼時候笑什麼不笑。這些東西變成了習慣--我們學習並融入到我們自己中的行為。

When we』re older, we』re a collection of thousands of habits constantly running subconsciously. We have a little bit of extra brainpower in our neocortex for solving new problems. You become your habits.

當我們變老的時候，我們是成千上萬個習慣的集合，潛意識裡一直在執行。我們的大腦皮層有一點額外的腦力來解決新問題。你就成了你的習慣。

This came to light for me when my trainer gave me a routine to do every single day. I had never worked out every single day before. It』s a light workout. It』s not tough on your body, but I did this workout every single day. I realized the incredible, astonishing transformation it had on me both physically and mentally.

當我的教練給了我一個每天要做的例行公事時，我發現了這一點。我以前從來沒有每天鍛鍊過。這是一次輕微的鍛鍊。這對你的身體來說並不難，但我每天都這樣鍛鍊。我意識到它對我的身體和精神都帶來了令人難以置信的、令人震驚的變化。

To have peace of mind, you have to have peace of body first.

要有心靈的安寧，首先要有身體的安寧。

This taught me the power of habits. I started realizing it』s all about habits. At any given time, I』m either trying to pick up a good habit or discard a previous bad habit. It takes time.

這教會了我習慣的力量。我開始意識到一切都與習慣有關。在任何時候，我要麼試著養成一個好習慣，要麼改掉以前的壞習慣。這需要時間。

If someone says, 「I want to be fit, I want to be healthy. Right now, I』m out of shape and I』m fat.」 Well, nothing sustainable is going to work for you in three months. It』s going to be at least a ten -year journey. Every six months (depending on how fast you can do it), you』re going to break bad habits and pick up good habits. [6]

如果有人說，「我想要健康，我想要健康。現在，我身材走樣，而且很胖。「嗯，三個月內沒有什麼可持續的東西會對你起作用。這將是一個至少十年的旅程。每六個月(取決於你能做到多快)，你會改掉壞習慣，養成好習慣。

One of the things Krishnamurti talks about is being in an internal state of revolution. You should always be internally ready for a complete change. Whenever we say we』re going to try to do something or try to form a habit, we』re wimping out.

克里希那穆提談到的其中一件事是處於革命的內部狀態。您應該始終在內部為徹底的改變做好準備。每當我們說要試著做某事或試著養成習慣時，我們就是在畏首畏尾。

We』re just saying to ourselves, 「I』m going to buy myself some more time.」 The reality is when our emotions want us to do something, we just do it. If you want to go approach a pretty girl, if you want to have a drink, if you really desire something, you just go do it.

我們只是在對自己說，「我要為自己爭取更多的時間。」現實是，當我們的情感要求我們去做某件事時，我們就去做。如果你想接近一個漂亮的女孩，如果你想喝一杯，如果你真的想要什麼，那就去做吧。

When you say, 「I』m going to do this,」 and 「I』m going to be that,」 you』re really putting it off. You』re giving yourself an out. At least if you』re self -aware , you can think, 「『I say I want to do this, but I don』t really because if I really wanted to do it, I would just do it.」

當你說「我要做這件事」和「我要做那件事」的時候，你真的是在拖延。你這是在給自己一條出路。至少如果你有自知之明，你可以想，「我說我想做這件事，但我並不是真的想做，因為如果我真的想做，我就會去做。」

Commit externally to enough people. For example, if you want to quit smoking, all you have to do is go to everybody you know and say, 「I quit smoking. I did it. I give you my word.」

對外承諾給足夠多的人。例如，如果你想戒菸，你所要做的就是去找所有你認識的人說，「我戒菸了。我做到了。我向你保證。「
That』s all you need to do. Go ahead, right? But most of us say we』re not quite ready. We know we don』t want to commit ourselves externally. It』s important to be honest with yourself and say, 「Okay, I』m not ready to give up smoking. I like it too much, it is going to be too hard for me to give up.」

這就是你需要做的全部事情。去吧，好嗎？但是我們大多數人都說我們還沒有完全準備好。我們知道我們不想對外承諾。對自己誠實並說，「好吧，我還沒準備好戒菸，這一點很重要。我太喜歡了，要放棄對我來說太難了。「
Say instead, 「I』ll set a more reasonable goal for myself; I』ll cut down to the following amount. I can commit to that externally. I』m going to work on that for three or six months. When I get there, I』ll take the next step, as opposed to beating myself up over it.」

相反，你可以說，「我會為自己設定一個更合理的目標，我會減少到以下數額。我可以對外承諾這一點。我要在這上面工作三到六個月。等我到了那裡，我會採取下一步行動，而不是為此而自責。「
When you really want to change, you just change. But most of us don』t really want to change—we don』t want to go through the pain just yet. At least recognize it, be aware of it, and give yourself a smaller change you can actually carry out. [6]

當你真的想改變的時候，你只要改變就行了。但是我們大多數人並不真的想改變--我們現在還不想經歷痛苦。至少要認識到這一點，意識到這一點，給自己一個你可以實際實施的小改變。

Impatience with actions, patience with results.

對行動不耐煩，對結果耐心。

Anything you have to do, just get it done. Why wait? You』re not getting any younger. Your life is slipping away. You don』t want to spend it waiting in line. You don』t want to spend it traveling back and forth. You don』t want to spend it doing things you know ultimately aren』t part of your mission.

不管你要做什麼，只要把它做完就行了。為什麼要等？你不會再年輕了。你的生命正在悄悄溜走。你不會想把這段時間花在排隊上的。你不會想把時間花在來回旅行上的。你不會想把時間花在做一些你知道最終不屬於你使命的事情上。

When you do them, you want to do them as quickly as you can while doing them well with your full attention. But then, you just have to be patient with the results because you』re dealing with complex systems and many people.

當你做它們的時候，你想要以最快的速度做它們，同時全神貫注地做好它們。但是，你只需要對結果保持耐心，因為你要處理的是複雜的系統和很多人。

It takes a long time for markets to adopt products. It takes time for people to get comfortable working with each other. It takes time for great products to emerge as you polish away, polish away, polish away. Impatience with actions, patience with results. As Nivi said, inspiration is perishable. When you have inspiration, act on it right then and there. [78]

市場需要很長時間才能採用產品。人們需要時間來適應彼此的工作。偉大的產品需要時間才能出現，就像你不斷地磨練、磨練、磨練一樣。對行動不耐煩，對結果耐心。正如尼維所說，靈感是易逝去的。當你有靈感的時候，馬上行動起來。
