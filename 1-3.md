## Find and Build Specific Knowledge

查詢並構建特定知識

Sales skills are a form of specific knowledge.

銷售技能是特定知識的一種形式。

There』s such a thing as 「a natural」 in sales. You run into them all the time in startups and venture capital. When you meet someone who is a natural at sales, you just know they』re amazing. They』re really good at what they do. That is a form of specific knowledge.

在銷售中有一種叫做「自然」的東西。在初創企業和風險投資中，你總是會遇到他們。當你遇到一個在銷售方面很有天賦的人時，你就會知道他們很令人驚歎。他們真的很擅長他們的工作。這是特定知識的一種形式。

Obviously they learned somewhere, but they didn』t learn it in a classroom setting. They learned probably in their childhood in the school yard, or they learned negotiating with their parents. Maybe some is a genetic component in the DNA.

顯然，他們是在某個地方學習的，但他們不是在課堂上學習的。他們可能是在童年時在學校院子里學習的，或者他們學會了與父母談判。也許有些是DNA中的遺傳成分。

But you can improve sales skills. You can read Robert Cialdini, you can go to a sales training seminar, you can do door -to -door sales. It is brutal but will train you very quickly. You can definitely improve your sales skills.

但是你可以提高銷售技巧。你可以讀羅伯特·恰爾迪尼的書，你可以去參加銷售培訓研討會，你可以上門推銷。這很殘酷，但會很快訓練你。你一定可以提高你的銷售技能。

Specific knowledge cannot be taught, but it can be learned.
具體的知識不能教，但可以學。

When I talk about specific knowledge, I mean figure out what you were doing as a kid or teenager almost effortlessly. Something you didn』t even consider a skill, but people around you noticed. Your mother or your best friend growing up would know.

當我談到具體知識時，我的意思是幾乎毫不費力地弄清楚你小時候或十幾歲時在做什麼。一些你甚至不認為是技能的東西，但是你周圍的人注意到了。你的母親或者你從小到大最好的朋友都會知道。

Examples of what your specific knowledge could be:

舉例說明您的特定知識可能是什麼：

* Sales skills銷售技巧
* Musical talents, with the ability to pick up any instrument音樂天賦，能拿起任何樂器
* An obsessive personality: you dive into things and remember them quickly　強迫型性格：你一頭扎進東西里，很快就能記住它們
* Love for science fiction: you were into reading sci -fi , which means you absorb a lot of knowledge very quickly　喜歡科幻：你喜歡看科幻小說，這意味著你很快就吸收了很多知識。
* Playing a lot of games, you understand game theory pretty well　玩了很多遊戲，你很懂博弈論
Gossiping, digging into your friend network. That might make you into a very interesting journalist.　八卦，挖掘你的朋友網路。這可能會讓你成為一名非常有趣的記者。

The specific knowledge is sort of this weird combination of unique traits from your DNA, your unique upbringing, and your response to it. It』s almost baked into your personality and your identity. Then you can hone it.

具體的知識是來自你的DNA的獨特特徵，你獨特的教養，以及你對此的反應的某種奇怪的組合。它幾乎已經融入了你的個性和身份。然後你就可以磨練它了。

No one can compete with you on being you.
在做你這一點上，沒有人能與你競爭。

Most of life is a search for who and what needs you the most.
人生的大部分時間都是在尋找最需要你的人和事。

For example, I love to read, and I love technology. I learn very quickly, and I get bored fast. If I had gone into a profession where I was required to tunnel down for twenty years into the same topic, it wouldn』t have worked. I』m in venture investing, which requires me to come up to speed very, very quickly on new technologies (and I』m rewarded for getting bored because new technologies come along). It matches up pretty well with my specific knowledge and skill sets. [10]

例如，我喜歡閱讀，我喜歡科技。我學得很快，我很快就會感到無聊。如果我從事的職業要求我在同一主題上鉆研二十年，那就行不通了。我從事的是風險投資，這要求我非常、非常快地掌握新技術(我會因為新技術的出現而感到無聊而得到獎勵)。它與我的特定知識和技能非常匹配。「[10]

I wanted to be a scientist. That is where a lot of my moral hierarchy comes from. I view scientists as being at the top of the production chain for humanity. The group of scientists who have made real breakthroughs and contributions probably added more to human society, I think, than any single other class of human beings. Not to take away anything from art or politics or engineering or business, but without science, we』d still be scrambling in the dirt fighting with sticks and trying to start fires.

我想成為一名科學家。這就是我的許多道德等級制度的來源。我認為科學家處於人類生產鏈的頂端。我認為，這群真正取得突破和貢獻的科學家對人類社會的貢獻可能比其他任何一個階層的人都多。我不想奪走藝術、政治、工程或商業上的任何東西，但如果沒有科學，我們仍然會在泥土中爭先恐後地用棍子搏鬥，試圖縱火。

Society, business, & money are downstream of technology, which is itself downstream of science. Science applied is the engine of humanity.

社會、商業和金錢都在技術的下游，而技術本身又在科學的下游。應用的科學是人類的引擎。

Corollary: Applied Scientists are the most powerful people in the world. This will be more obvious in the coming years.

推論：應用科學家是世界上最有權勢的人。這一點在未來幾年將更加明顯。

My whole value system was built around scientists, and I wanted to be a great scientist. But when I actually look back at what I was uniquely good at and what I ended up spending my time doing, it was more around making money, tinkering with technology, and selling people on things. Explaining things and talking to people.



我的整個價值體系都是圍繞科學家建立的，我想成為一名偉大的科學家。但當我真正回顧我唯一擅長的是什麼，以及我最終把時間花在了什麼上時，我更多地是在賺錢，修補技術，向人們推銷東西。解釋事情，和人們交談。

I have some sales skills, which is a form of specific knowledge. I have some analytical skills on how to make money. And I have this ability to absorb data, obsess about it, and break it down—that is a specific skill that I have. I also love tinkering with technology. And all of this stuff feels like play to me, but it looks like work to others.
我有一些銷售技能，這是具體知識的一種形式。我對如何賺錢有一些分析技巧。我有能力吸收數據，沉迷於它，並將其分解--這是我擁有的一項特殊技能。我也喜歡修補技術。所有這些東西對我來說都像是玩樂，但對其他人來說卻像是工作。

There are other people to whom these things would be hard, and they say, 「Well, how do I get good at being pithy and selling ideas?」 Well, if you』re not already good at it or if you』re not really into it, maybe it』s not your thing—focus on the thing that you are really into.
還有一些人很難做到這一點，他們會說，「那麼，我怎樣才能變得精練，善於推銷想法呢？」嗯，如果你還不擅長它，或者你不是真的喜歡它，也許這不是你的事情--專注於你真正喜歡的事情。

The first person to actually point out my real specific knowledge was my mother. She did it as an aside, talking from the kitchen, and she said it when I was fifteen or sixteen years old. I was telling a friend of mine that I want to be an astrophysicist, and she said, 「No, you』re going to go into business.」 I was like, 「What, my mom』s telling me I』m going to be in business? I』m going to be an astrophysicist. Mom doesn』t know she』s talking about.」 But Mom knew exactly what she was talking about. [78]

第一個真正指出我的具體知識的人是我的母親。她在廚房裡說話，只是順便說一句，她在我十五六歲的時候說了這句話。我告訴我的一個朋友，我想成為一名天體物理學家，她說，「不，你要做生意。」我就想，「什麼，我媽媽告訴我我要做生意？我要成為一名天體物理學家。媽媽不知道她在說什麼。「但是媽媽非常清楚她在說什麼。

Specific knowledge is found much more by pursuing your innate talents, your genuine curiosity, and your passion. It』s not by going to school for whatever is the hottest job; it』s not by going into whatever field investors say is the hottest.

通過追求你與生俱來的才華、你真正的好奇心和你的熱情，可以發現更多具體的知識。這並不是爲了什麼最熱門的工作而去上學，也不是通過進入投資者所說的最熱門的領域。

Very often, specific knowledge is at the edge of knowledge. It』s also stuff that』s only now being figured out or is really hard to figure out. If you』re not 100 percent into it, somebody else who is 100 percent into it will outperform you. And they won』t just outperform you by a little bit—they』ll outperform you by a lot because now we』re operating the domain of ideas, compound interest really applies and leverage really applies. [78]
很多時候，具體的知識處於知識的邊緣。它也是現在才被弄清楚或者真的很難弄清楚的東西。如果你不是百分之百投入其中，那麼其他百分百投入其中的人會比你表現得更好。而且他們的表現不會只比你稍微好一點-他們會比你表現得好很多，因為現在我們正在經營思想領域，複利真的適用，槓桿真的適用。「[78]

The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven』t figured this out yet.

網際網路極大地拓寬了可能的職業空間。大多數人還沒有弄清楚這一點。

You can go on the internet, and you can find your audience. And you can build a business, and create a product, and build wealth, and make people happy just uniquely expressing yourself through the internet. [78]

你可以上網，你可以找到你的觀眾。你可以建立一個企業，創造一個產品，創造財富，僅僅通過網際網路獨特地表達你自己就能讓人們感到快樂。「[78]

The internet enables any niche interest, as long as you』re the best person at it to scale out. And the great news is because every human is different, everyone is the best at something—being themselves.

只要你是向外擴充套件的最佳人選，網際網路就能讓你對任何利基市場感興趣。好訊息是，因為每個人都是不同的，每個人都是最擅長的--做自己。

Another tweet I had that is worth weaving in, but didn』t go into the 「How to Get Rich」 tweetstorm, was very simple: 「Escape competition through authenticity.」 Basically, when you』re competing with people, it』s because you』re copying them. It』s because you』re trying to do the same thing. But every human is different. Don』t copy. [78]

我的另一條推文很簡單，很值得編織進去，但沒有進入「如何致富」的推文風暴：「通過真實來逃避競爭。」基本上，當你與人競爭時，是因為你在模仿他們。那是因為你也在試著做同樣的事情。但是每個人都是不同的。不要抄襲。「[78]

If you are fundamentally building and marketing something that is an extension of who you are, no one can compete with you on that. Who』s going to compete with Joe Rogan or Scott Adams? It』s impossible. Is somebody else going to come along and write a better Dilbert? No. Is someone going to compete with Bill Watterson and create a better Calvin and Hobbes? No. They』re being authentic. [78]

如果你從根本上構建和營銷的東西是你自己的延伸，沒有人能在這方面與你競爭。誰將與喬·羅根或斯科特·亞當斯競爭？不可能的。會有其他人來寫一部更好的呆伯特作品嗎？不是的。會有人與比爾·沃特森競爭，創造一個更好的加爾文和霍布斯嗎？不是的。他們是真實的。)[78]

The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed. They are creative expressions of continuous learners in free markets.

最好的工作既不是命令，也不是學位。它們是自由市場中不斷學習的人的創造性表現。

The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. You have to know how to learn anything you want to learn. The old model of making money is going to school for four years, getting your degree, and working as a professional for thirty years. But things change fast now. Now, you have to come up to speed on a new profession within nine months, and it』s obsolete four years later. But within those three productive years, you can get very wealthy.

致富最重要的技能是成為一個永久的學習者。你必須知道如何學習任何你想學的東西。舊的賺錢模式是上學四年，拿到學位，做三十年的專業人員。但現在情況變化很快。現在，你必須在九個月內跟上一個新職業的步伐，四年後它就過時了。但在這三年內，你可以變得非常富有。

It』s much more important today to be able to become an expert in a brand -new field in nine to twelve months than to have studied the 「right」 thing a long time ago. You really care about having studied the foundations, so you』re not scared of any book. If you go to the library and there』s a book you cannot understand, you have to dig down and say, 「What is the foundation required for me to learn this?」 Foundations are super important. [74]

今天，能夠在9到12個月內成為一個全新領域的專家，比起很久以前研究「正確」的東西要重要得多。你真的很在乎學過基礎，所以你什麼書都不怕。如果你去圖書館，發現一本你看不懂的書，你必須向下挖掘，然後說：「我學習這本書需要什麼基礎？」基礎是超級重要的。

Basic arithmetic and numeracy are way more important in life than doing calculus. Similarly, being able to convey yourself simply using ordinary English words is far more important than being able to write poetry, having an extensive vocabulary, or speaking seven different foreign languages.

在生活中，基本的算術和算術比微積分重要得多。同樣，能夠簡單地用普通的英語單詞表達自己，要比會寫詩、詞彙量大或會說七種不同的外語重要得多。

Knowing how to be persuasive when speaking is far more important than being an expert digital marketer or click optimizer. Foundations are key. It』s much better to be at 9/10 or 10/10 on foundations than to try and get super deep into things.

知道如何在演講時具有說服力比成為一名專業的數字營銷者或點選優化器要重要得多。基礎是關鍵。在基礎上保持9/10或10/10比試圖深入到事情中要好得多。

You do need to be deep in something because otherwise you』ll be a mile wide and an inch deep and you won』t get what you want out of life. You can only achieve mastery in one or two things. It』s usually things you』re obsessed about. [74]

你確實需要深入到某件事中去，否則你會陷入一英里寬一英吋深的境地，你將得不到你想從生活中得到的東西。你只能在一兩件事上做到精通。這通常是你癡迷的事情。
