# Eric』s Note (About This Book)

埃里克的筆記(關於這本書)

Throughout his career, Naval has generously shared his wisdom, and millions of people around the world follow his advice on building wealth and living happily.

在他的整個職業生涯中，納瓦爾慷慨地分享了他的智慧，世界各地數百萬人聽從了他關於積累財富和幸福生活的建議。

Naval Ravikant is an icon in Silicon Valley and startup culture around the world. He founded multiple successful companies (Epinions during the 2000 dot -com crash, AngelList in 2010). Naval is also an angel investor, betting early on companies like Uber, Twitter, Postmates, and hundreds more.

Naval Ravikant是硅谷的偶像，也是世界各地的創業文化。他創立了多家成功的公司(2000年網際網路崩盤時的Epinions，2010年的AngelList)。納瓦爾也是一位天使投資者，很早就押注于優步(Uber)、Twitter、Postmate等數百家公司。

More than a financial success, Naval has been sharing his own philosophy of life and happiness, attracting readers and listeners throughout the world. Naval is broadly followed because he is a rare combination of successful and happy. After a lifetime of study and application of philosophy, economics, and wealth creation, he has proven the impact of his principles.

除了經濟上的成功，納瓦爾還分享了他自己的人生和幸福哲學，吸引了世界各地的讀者和聽眾。納瓦爾受到廣泛關注，因為他是成功和快樂的罕見組合。經過畢生對哲學、經濟學和財富創造的研究和應用，他證明了他的原則的影響力。

Today, Naval continues to build and invest in companies almost casually, in his own artistic way, while maintaining a healthy, peaceful, and balanced life. This book collects and organizes the pieces of wisdom he has shared and shows you how to achieve the same for yourself.

今天，納瓦爾繼續以他自己的藝術方式幾乎隨意地建立和投資公司，同時保持健康、和平和平衡的生活。這本書收集並整理了他分享的智慧，並向你展示瞭如何為自己實現同樣的目標。

Naval』s life story is instructive. An introspective founder, self -taught investor, capitalist, and engineer certainly has something to teach us all.

納瓦爾的生平故事很有啓發性。一位自省的創始人、自學成才的投資者、資本家和工程師肯定有東西可以教給我們所有人。

As a first -principles thinker with no fear of speaking his truth, Naval』s thoughts are often unique and thought -provoking . His instinct for seeing through life』s veneer has changed how I see the world.

作為一個不怕說真話的第一原則思想家，納瓦爾的思想常常是獨一無二的，發人深省。他看穿生活表象的本能改變了我看待世界的方式。

I』ve learned an enormous amount from Naval. Reading, listening, and applying his principles of wealth and happiness has given me calm confidence on my path and taught me to enjoy every moment of this journey. Closely studying his career has shown me how great things are accomplished through small, persistent steps, and how large an impact one individual can have.

我從納瓦爾那裡學到了很多。閱讀、傾聽和應用他的財富和幸福原則，給了我在道路上平靜的信心，並教會了我享受這段旅程的每一刻。仔細研究他的職業生涯讓我看到，偉大的事情是如何通過小小的、堅持不懈的步驟完成的，以及一個人能產生多大的影響。

I refer to his work often and recommend it to friends. Those conversations inspired me to create this book, so people can learn from his perspective whether they』re new to Naval』s ideas or have followed him the past ten years.

我經常參考他的作品，並把它推薦給朋友。這些對話激發了我創作這本書的靈感，這樣人們就可以從他的角度瞭解到，無論他們是對納瓦爾的想法是新的，還是在過去的十年裡一直關注他。

This book collects the wisdom shared by Naval over the past decade in his own words through Twitter, blog posts, and podcasts. With this book, you can get the benefits of a lifetime in a few hours.

這本書通過推特、部落格帖子和播客收集了納瓦爾在過去十年中分享的智慧，用他自己的話說。有了這本書，你可以在幾個小時內得到一生的好處。

I created this book as a public service. Tweets, podcasts, and interviews quickly get buried and lost. Knowledge this valuable deserves a more permanent, accessible format. That is my mission with this book.

我創作這本書是作為一項公共服務。推特、播客和採訪很快就會被淹沒和丟失。這種有價值的知識應該有一種更持久、更容易獲得的形式。這就是我寫這本書的使命。

I hope this acts as an introduction to Naval』s ideas. I』ve collected his most powerful and useful ideas in his own words, woven them into a readable thread, and organized those into sections for easy reference.

我希望這能作為對納瓦爾思想的介紹。我用他自己的話收集了他最有力和最有用的想法，將它們編織成一條可讀的線索，並將它們組織成幾個部分，以便於參考。

I often find myself reviewing sections of this book before making an investment or opening to the Happiness chapter if I』m feeling off. Creating this book has changed me. I feel more clarity, confidence, and peace through all aspects of life. I hope reading it will do the same for you.

我經常發現自己在進行投資之前會複習這本書的幾個章節，如果我感覺不舒服的話，就會打開「幸福」一章。創作這本書改變了我。我在生活的方方面面都感受到了更清晰、更自信、更平和。我希望讀一讀它也會對你有同樣的幫助。

The Almanack is intended as a guide to be read and consulted for specific topics. If Naval doesn』t answer your emails, I hope this book gives you the next -best advice.

年鑑旨在作為特定主題的閱讀和參考指南。如果納瓦爾不回覆你的電子郵件，我希望這本書能給你下一個最好的建議。

This book is an introduction to Naval and dives deeply into his two most -explored topics: wealth and happiness. If you want to continue exploring Naval and his other ideas, I encourage you to check out the 「Next on Naval」 section at the end of this book. I』ve shared chapters that were edited out of the final book, as well as other popular resources.

這本書是對納瓦爾的介紹，深入探討了他探索最多的兩個主題：財富和幸福。如果你想繼續探索納瓦爾和他的其他想法，我建議你看看本書末尾的「納瓦爾的下一步」部分。我已經分享了最後一本書中被編輯掉的章節，以及其他受歡迎的資源。

Be well,

好好保重，

Eric
