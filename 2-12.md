# Choosing to Be Yourself

選擇做你自己

A lot of what goes on today is what many of you are doing right now—beating yourself up and scribbling notes and saying, 「I need to do this, and I need to do that, and I need to do…」 No, you don』t need to do anything.

今天發生的很多事情就是你們中的許多人現在正在做的--痛打自己，草草寫下筆記，然後說，「我需要這樣做，我需要這樣做，我需要那樣做，我需要做…。」不，你什麼都不需要做。

All you should do is what you want to do. If you stop trying to figure out how to do things the way other people want you to do them, you get to listen to the little voice inside your head that wants to do things a certain way. Then, you get to be you.

你應該做的就是你想做的事。如果你不再試圖弄清楚如何按照別人希望你做的方式去做事情，你就會聽到你腦海中想要以某種方式做事情的那個小小的聲音。然後，你就可以做你自己了。

I never met my greatest mentor. I wanted so much to be like him. But his message was the opposite: Be yourself, with passionate intensity.

我從未見過我最好的導師。我很想像他一樣。但他傳達的資訊恰恰相反：做你自己，帶著激情的強度。

No one in the world is going to beat you at being you. You』re never going to be as good at being me as I am. I』m never going to be as good at being you as you are. Certainly, listen and absorb, but don』t try to emulate. It』s a fool』s errand. Instead, each person is uniquely qualified at something. They have some specific knowledge, capability, and desire nobody else in the world does, purely from the combinatorics of human DNA and development.

世界上沒有人能打敗你做你自己。你永遠不會像我一樣擅長做我我永遠不會像你那樣擅長做你。當然，傾聽和吸收，但不要試圖效仿。這是愚蠢的差事。相反，每個人在某些方面都是獨一無二的。他們有一些世界上其他人沒有的特定知識、能力和願望，純粹是從人類DNA和發育的組合中獲得的。

The combinatorics of human DNA and experience are staggering. You will never meet any two humans who are substitutable for each other.

人類DNA和經驗的組合是驚人的。你永遠不會遇到任何兩個可以相互替代的人類。

Your goal in life is to find the people, business, project, or art that needs you the most. There is something out there just for you. What you don』t want to do is build checklists and decision frameworks built on what other people are doing. You』re never going to be them. You』ll never be good at being somebody else. [4]

你的人生目標是找到最需要你的人、生意、專案或藝術。外面有一些東西是專為你準備的。你不想做的是建立建立在其他人正在做的事情上的檢查表和決策框架。你永遠不會成為他們。你永遠不會擅長做別人。

To make an original contribution, you have to be irrationally obsessed with something.

要做出原創性的貢獻，你必須非理性地執著于某件事。
