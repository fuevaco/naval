#  Play Long-Term Games with Long-Term People

與長期的人一起玩長期遊戲

You said, 「All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.」 How does one know if they』re earning compound interest?

你說過，「生活中所有的回報，無論是財富、關係還是知識，都來自複利。」怎麼知道他們是否賺取了複利呢？

Compound interest is a very powerful concept. Compound interest applies to more than just compounding capital. Compounding capital is just the beginning.
複利是一個非常強大的概念。複利不僅僅適用於複利資本。複合資本只是個開始。

Compounding in business relationships is very important. Look at some of the top roles in society, like why someone is a CEO of a public company or managing billions of dollars. It』s because people trust them. They are trusted because the relationships they』ve built and the work they』ve done has compounded. They』ve stuck with the business and shown themselves (in a visible and accountable way) to be high -integrity people.

商業關係中的複利是非常重要的。看看社會上的一些最高職位，比如為什麼有人是上市公司的執行長，或者管理著數十億美元的資產。這是因為人們信任他們。他們之所以值得信任，是因為他們建立的關係和他們所做的工作相得益彰。他們堅持自己的業務，並(以一種明顯和負責任的方式)展示了自己是高度正直的人。

Compound interest also happens in your reputation. If you have a sterling reputation and you keep building it for decades upon decades, people will notice. Your reputation will literally end up being thousands or tens of thousands of times more valuable than somebody else who was very talented but is not keeping the compound interest in reputation going.

複利也會影響你的聲譽。如果你擁有卓越的聲譽，並在幾十年的時間裡不斷建立這種聲譽，人們就會注意到。你的聲譽最終會比那些才華橫溢但沒有保持聲譽的複利的人高出幾千倍或幾萬倍。

This is also true when you』re working with individual people. If you』ve worked with somebody for five or ten years and you still enjoy working with them, obviously you trust them, and the little foibles are gone. All the normal negotiations in business relationships can work very simply because you trust each other—you know it will work out.

當你和個別人一起工作時，這也是正確的。如果你和某人共事了五年或十年，而你仍然喜歡和他們一起工作，顯然你信任他們，小缺點也就消失了。商業關係中所有正常的談判都能奏效，原因很簡單，因為你們彼此信任--你知道它會成功的。

For example, there』s another Angel in Silicon Valley named Elad Gil who I like to do deals with.
例如，硅谷有一個叫Elad Gil的天使，我喜歡和他做交易。

I love working with Elad because I know when the deal is being done, he will bend over backward to give me extra. He will always round off in my favor if there』s an extra dollar being delivered here or there. If there』s some cost to pay, he will pay it out of his own pocket, and he won』t even mention it to me. Because he goes so far out of his way to treat me so well, I send him every deal I have—I try to include him in everything. Then, I go out of my way to try and pay for him. Compounding in those relationships is very valuable. [10]

我喜歡和埃拉德一起工作，因為我知道當交易完成時，他會竭盡全力給我額外的報酬。如果這裡或那裡多出一美元，他總是會對我有利的。如果要付一些費用，他會自掏腰包，他甚至不會跟我提這件事。因為他不遺餘力地對我如此好，我把我的每一筆交易都寄給他-我試著把他包括在每一件事上。然後，我不厭其煩地試著為他付錢。在這些關係中進行復利是非常有價值的。

Intentions don』t matter. Actions do. That』s why being ethical is hard.
意圖並不重要。行動能做到這一點。這就是為什麼道德是很難做到的。

When you find the right thing to do, when you find the right people to work with, invest deeply. Sticking with it for decades is really how you make the big returns in your relationships and in your money. So, compound interest is very important. [10]
當你找到要做的正確事情時，當你找到合適的人一起工作時，進行深度投資。堅持幾十年是你在人際關係和金錢中獲得巨大回報的真正方式。因此，複利非常重要。「[10]
99% of effort is wasted.
99%的努力都白費了。

Obviously, nothing is ever completely wasted because it』s all a learning moment. You can learn from anything. But for example, when you go back to school, 99 percent of the term papers you did, books you read, exercises you did, things you learned, they don』t really apply. You might have read geography and history you never reuse. You might have studied a language you don』t speak anymore. You might have studied a branch of mathematics you completely forgot.

顯然，沒有什麼是完全浪費的，因為這都是一個學習的時刻。你可以從任何事情中學習。但是，例如，當你回到學校時，你做的99%的學期論文，你讀的書，你做的練習，你學到的東西，它們並不真正適用。你可能讀過從未重複使用過的地理和歷史。你可能學過一門你不再會說的語言。你可能學過一門你完全忘記的數學分支。

Of course, these are learning experiences. You did learn. You learned the value of hard work; you might have learned something that went deep into your psyche and became a piece of what you』re doing now. But at least when it comes to the goal -oriented life, only about 1 percent of the efforts you made paid off.

當然，這些都是學習的經歷。你確實學到了。你學到了努力工作的價值；你可能學到了一些東西，這些東西深入你的心靈，成為你現在正在做的事情的一部分。但至少在以目標為導向的生活中，你所做的努力只有1%得到了回報。

Another example is all the people you dated until you met your husband or wife. It was wasted time in the goal sense. Not wasted in the exponential sense, not wasted in the learning sense, but definitely wasted in the goal sense.

另一個例子是所有你約會過的人，直到你遇到你的丈夫或妻子。這是在目標意義上浪費時間。不是指數意義上的浪費，不是學習意義上的浪費，而是目標意義上的絕對浪費。

The reason I say this is not to make some glib comment about how 99 percent of your life is wasted and only 1 percent is useful. I say this because you should be very thoughtful and realize in most things (relationships, work, even in learning) what you』re trying to do is find the thing you can go all -in on to earn compound interest.

我這麼說的原因不是要對你99%的生命是如何浪費的，只有1%是有用的，做些油嘴滑舌的評論。我這麼說是因為你應該非常深思熟慮，在大多數事情上(人際關係、工作，甚至是學習)都應該意識到，你要做的是找到你可以全力以赴賺取複利的東西。

When you』re dating, the instant you know this relationship is not going to be the one that leads to marriage, you should probably move on. When you』re studying something, like a geography or history class, and you realize you are never going to use the information, drop the class. It』s a waste of time. It』s a waste of your brain energy.

當你在約會的時候，當你知道這段關係不會導致婚姻的那一刻，你可能就應該向前看了。當你在學習一些東西時，比如地理或歷史課，你意識到你永遠不會用到這些資訊，那就放棄這門課。純屬浪費時間。這是在浪費你的腦力。

I』m not saying don』t do the 99 percent, because it』s very hard to identify what the 1 percent is. What I』m saying is: when you find the 1 percent of your discipline which will not be wasted, which you』ll be able to invest in for the rest of your life and has meaning to you—go all -in and forget about the rest. [10]

我不是說不要做99%，因為很難確定1%是什麼。我的意思是：當你發現你的1%的紀律不會被浪費，你將能夠在你的餘生中投資，並且對你有意義--全力以赴，忘掉其餘的。
