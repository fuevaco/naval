#  Build or Buy Equity in a Business

在企業中建立或購買股權

If you don』t own a piece of a business, you don』t have a path towards financial freedom.
如果你不擁有一家企業的一部分，你就沒有一條通往財務自由的道路。

Why is owning equity in a business important to becoming rich?
為什麼擁有一家企業的股權對致富很重要？

It』s ownership versus wage work. If you are paid for renting out your time, even lawyers and doctors, you can make some money, but you』re not going to make the money that gives you financial freedom. You』re not going to have passive income where a business is earning for you while you are on vacation. [10]

這是所有權與工資性工作的較量。如果你的時間是租出去的，即使是律師和醫生，你也可以賺到一些錢，但你賺不到給你財務自由的錢。你不會有被動收入，因為在你度假期間，企業正在為你賺錢。「[10]
This is probably one of the most important points. People seem to think you can create wealth—make money through work. It』s probably not going to work. There are many reasons for that.
這可能是最重要的一點。人們似乎認為你可以創造財富--通過工作賺錢。這可能行不通。這其中有很多原因。

Without ownership, your inputs are very closely tied to your outputs. In almost any salaried job, even one paying a lot per hour like a lawyer or a doctor, you』re still putting in the hours, and every hour you get paid.

如果沒有所有權，您的輸入將與您的輸出緊密地聯繫在一起。幾乎在任何一份有工資的工作中，即使是像律師或醫生這樣的時薪很高的工作，你仍然在投入時間，而且每小時你都能拿到工資。

Without ownership, when you』re sleeping, you』re not earning. When you』re retired, you』re not earning. When you』re on vacation, you』re not earning. And you can』t earn nonlinearly.
如果沒有所有權，當你睡覺的時候，你就賺不到錢。當你退休后，你就賺不到錢了。當你在度假的時候，你賺不到錢。而且你不能非線性地賺錢。

If you look at even doctors who get rich (like really rich), it』s because they open a business. They open a private practice. The private practice builds a brand, and the brand attracts people. Or they build some kind of a medical device, a procedure, or a process with an intellectual property.

如果你看看那些致富的醫生(比如真的很有錢)，那是因為他們開了一家公司。他們開了一家私人診所。私人執業打造品牌，品牌吸引人。或者他們製造某種具有智慧財產權的醫療裝置、程式或過程。

Essentially, you』re working for somebody else, and that person is taking on the risk and has the accountability, the intellectual property, and the brand. They』re not going to pay you enough. They』re going to pay you the bare minimum they have to, to get you to do their job. That can be a high bare minimum, but it』s still not going to be true wealth where you』re retired but still earning. [78]

從本質上說，你是在為別人工作，而這個人正在承擔風險，承擔責任，擁有智慧財產權和品牌。他們不會付給你足夠的錢。爲了讓你做他們的工作，他們會付給你最低工資。這可能是一個很高的最低限度，但在你退休但仍在賺錢的地方，這仍然不會是真正的財富。「[78]

Owning equity in a company basically means you own the upside. When you own debt, you own guaranteed revenue streams and you own the downside. You want to own equity. If you don』t own equity in a business, your odds of making money are very slim.

擁有一家公司的股權基本上意味著你擁有上行空間。當你擁有債務時，你就擁有了有保證的收入來源，你就擁有了下行空間。你想擁有股權。如果你不擁有一家企業的股權，你賺錢的機會就非常渺茫。

You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in a business. You could own equity as a small shareholder where you bought stock. You could also own it as an owner where you started the company. Ownership is really important. [10]

你必須努力工作，直到你可以擁有一家企業的股權。你可以作為小股東持有股權，在那裡你購買了股票。你也可以作為你創辦公司的所有者擁有它。所有權真的很重要。「[10]

Everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, a business, or some IP. That can be through stock options if you work at a tech company. That』s a fine way to start.
每個在某個時候真正賺錢的人都擁有一件產品、一家企業或一些智慧財產權。如果你在一家科技公司工作，那可以通過股票期權來實現。這是一個很好的開始方式。

But usually, the real wealth is created by starting your own companies or even by investing. In an investment firm, they』re buying equity. These are the routes to wealth. It doesn』t come through the hours. [78]

但通常情況下，真正的財富是通過創辦自己的公司，甚至是通過投資來創造的。在一家投資公司，他們在購買股權。這些都是致富之路。它不是通過時間來的。)[78]
