# Be Patient

要有耐心

One thing I figured out later in life is generally (at least in the tech business in Silicon Valley), great people have great outcomes. You just have to be patient. Every person I met at the beginning of my career twenty years ago, where I looked at them and said, 「Wow, that guy or gal is super capable—so smart and dedicated」…all of them, almost without exception, became extremely successful. You just had to give them a long enough timescale. It never happens in the timescale you want, or they want, but it does happen. [4]

我在後來的生活中發現的一件事是，通常(至少在硅谷的科技行業)，偉大的人會有偉大的成就。你只要有耐心就行了。20年前我剛開始職業生涯時遇到的每一個人，我看著他們說，「哇，那個傢伙或女孩非常能幹--如此聰明和敬業。」…他們幾乎無一例外地都獲得了極大的成功。你只要給他們足夠長的時間就行了。它永遠不會在你想要的時間範圍內發生，也不會在他們想要的時間範圍內發生，但它確實會發生。

Apply specific knowledge with leverage and eventually, you will get what you deserve.

用槓桿運用特定的知識，最終，你會得到你應得的。

It takes time—even once you have all of these pieces in place, there is an indeterminate amount of time you have to put in. If you』re counting, you』ll run out of patience before success actually arrives.

這需要時間-即使你把所有這些東西都準備好了，你也必須投入不確定的時間。如果你在計算，在成功真正到來之前，你就會失去耐心。

Everybody wants to get rich immediately, but the world is an efficient place; immediate doesn』t work. You do have to put in the time. You do have to put in the hours, and so I think you have to put yourself in the position with the specific knowledge, with accountability, with leverage, with the authentic skill set you have, to be the best in the world at what you do.

每個人都想立即致富，但這個世界是一個高效的地方；立即致富是行不通的。你確實需要投入時間。你確實必須投入時間，所以我認為你必須把自己放在有具體知識、有責任、有槓桿、有真正技能的位置上，才能在你所做的事情上成為世界上最好的。

You have to enjoy it and keep doing it, keep doing it, and keep doing it. Don』t keep track, and don』t keep count because if you do, you will run out of time. [78]

你必須樂在其中，堅持下去。不要記賬，也不要記數，因為如果你這樣做，你的時間就會用完。「[78]

The most common bad advice I hear is: 「You』re too young.」 Most of history was built by young people. They just got credit when they were older. The only way to truly learn something is by doing it. Yes, listen to guidance. But don』t wait. [3]

我聽到的最常見的壞建議是：「你太年輕了。」歷史的大部分是由年輕人創造的。他們只是在年紀大的時候才拿到學分。真正學到東西的唯一方法就是去做。是的，聽從指導。但不要等待。「[3]

People are oddly consistent. Karma is just you, repeating your patterns, virtues, and flaws until you finally get what you deserve.

人們出奇地始終如一。業力就是你，不斷重複你的模式、美德和缺點，直到你最終得到你應得的。

Always pay it forward. And don』t keep count.

永遠要把它發揚光大。別再數了。

This is not to say it』s easy. It』s not easy. It』s actually really freaking hard. It is the hardest thing you will do. But it』s also rewarding. Look at the kids who are born rich—they have no meaning to their lives.

這並不是說這很容易。這並不容易。實際上真的很難。這是你要做的最難的事。但這也是值得的。看看那些天生富有的孩子--他們對自己的生活毫無意義。

Your real résumé is just a catalog of all your suffering. If I ask you to describe your real life to yourself, and you look back from your deathbed at the interesting things you』ve done, it』s all going to be around the sacrifices you made, the hard things you did.

你真正的簡歷只是你所有痛苦的目錄。如果我讓你向自己描述一下你的真實生活，當你在臨終前回顧你所做的有趣的事情時，一切都會圍繞著你所做出的犧牲，你所做的那些艱難的事情。

However, anything you』re given doesn』t matter. You have your four limbs, your brain, your head, your skin—that』s all for granted. You have to do hard things anyway to create your own meaning in life. Making money is a fine thing to choose. Go struggle. It is hard. I』m not going to say it』s easy. It』s really hard, but the tools are all available. It』s all out there. [77]

然而，你得到的任何東西都無關緊要。你有你的四肢，你的大腦，你的頭，你的面板--這些都是理所當然的。不管怎樣，你必須做一些艱難的事情來創造你自己的生活意義。賺錢是一件不錯的選擇。去奮鬥吧。這很難。我不會說這很容易。這真的很難，但是工具都是可用的。這一切都在那裡。)[77]

Money buys you freedom in the material world. It』s not going to make you happy, it』s not going to solve your health problems, it』s not going to make your family great, it』s not going to make you fit, it』s not going to make you calm. But it will solve a lot of external problems. It』s a reasonable step to go ahead and make money. [10]

在物質世界裡，金錢可以買到自由。它不會讓你快樂，不會解決你的健康問題，不會讓你的家庭變得美好，不會讓你健康，不會讓你平靜。但它會解決很多外部問題。這是向前走並賺錢的合理一步。「[10]

What making money will do is solve your money problems. It will remove a set of things that could get in the way of being happy, but it is not going to make you happy. I know many very wealthy people who are unhappy. Most of the time, the person you have to become to make money is a high -anxiety , high -stress , hard -working , competitive person. When you have done that for twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years, and you suddenly make money, you can』t turn it off. You』ve trained yourself to be a high -anxiety person. Then, you have to learn how to be happy. [11]

賺錢會解決你的錢問題。它會移除一系列可能阻礙你快樂的事情，但不會讓你快樂。我認識很多非常富有的人，他們並不快樂。大多數時候，爲了賺錢你必須成為一個高度焦慮、高度緊張、努力工作、有競爭力的人。當你做了二十年、三十年、四十年、五十年後，你突然賺到了錢，你就不能把它關掉。你把自己訓練成一個高度焦慮的人。然後，你必須學會如何快樂。

Let』s get you rich first. I』m very practical about it because, you know, Buddha was a prince. He started off really rich, then he got to go off in the woods.

我們先讓你發財吧。我對此非常實際，因為，你知道，佛陀是一位王子。他一開始很有錢，然後去了森林。

In the old days, if you wanted to be peaceful inside, you would become a monk. You would give up everything, renounce sex, children, money, politics, science, technology, everything, and you would go out in the woods by yourself. You had to give everything up to be free inside.

在過去，如果你想內心安寧，你就會成為一名僧侶。你會放棄一切，放棄性、孩子、金錢、政治、科學、技術，什麼都不做，然後你就會獨自一人走進森林。你必須放棄一切才能獲得內心的自由。

Today, with this wonderful invention called money, you can store it in a bank account. You can you work really hard, do great things for society, and society will give you money for things it wants but doesn』t know how to get. You can save money, you can live a little below your means, and you can find a certain freedom.

今天，有了這項叫做貨幣的奇妙發明，你可以把它存入銀行賬戶。你可以非常努力地工作，為社會做偉大的事情，社會會給你錢去買它想要但不知道怎麼得到的東西。你可以省錢，你可以過入不敷出的生活，你可以找到某種自由。

That will give you the time and the energy to pursue your own internal peace and happiness. I believe the solution to making everybody happy is to give them what they want.

這會給你時間和精力去追求自己內心的平靜和幸福。我相信讓每個人都開心的解決辦法就是給他們想要的東西。

Let』s get them all rich.

讓我們讓他們都發財吧。

Let』s get them all fit and healthy.

讓我們讓他們都身體健康吧。

Then, let』s get them all happy. [77]
那麼，讓我們讓他們所有人都開心吧。

Amazing how many people confuse wealth and wisdom.

令人驚訝的是，有那麼多人把財富和智慧混為一談。
