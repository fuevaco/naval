#  How to Get Lucky

如何獲得幸運

Why do you say, 「Get rich without getting lucky」?

你為什麼說「致富不需走運」？

In 1,000 parallel universes, you want to be wealthy in 999 of them. You don』t want to be wealthy in the fifty of them where you got lucky, so we want to factor luck out of it.
在1000個平行宇宙中，你想要在其中的999箇中變得富有。你不會想要在你幸運的50個國家裡變得富有，所以我們想把運氣因素考慮在內。

But getting lucky would help, right?

但走運會有幫助的，對吧？

Just recently, Babak Nivi, my co -founder , and I were talking on Twitter about how one gets lucky, and there are really four kinds of luck we were talking about.
就在最近，我的聯合創始人巴巴克·尼維(Babak Nivi)和我在推特上討論了一個人是如何走運的，我們談論的運氣真的有四種。

The first kind of luck is blind luck where one just gets lucky because something completely out of their control happened. This includes fortune, fate, etc.

第一種運氣是盲目的運氣，人們只是因為發生了完全不受他們控制的事情而幸運。這包括財富、命運等。

Then, there』s luck through persistence, hard work, hustle, and motion. This is when you』re running around creating opportunities. You』re generating a lot of energy, you』re doing a lot to stir things up. It』s almost like mixing a petri dish or mixing a bunch of reagents and seeing what combines. You』re just generating enough force, hustle, and energy for luck to find you.

然後，通過堅持不懈、努力工作、匆忙和行動來獲得運氣。這是你四處奔跑創造機會的時候。你產生了很大的能量，你做了很多事情來挑起事端。這幾乎就像混合一個培養皿或混合一堆試劑，然後看看是什麼結合在一起。你只是產生了足夠的力量、忙碌和能量，好讓幸運找到你。

A third way is you become very good at spotting luck. If you are very skilled in a field, you will notice when a lucky break happens in your field, and other people who aren』t attuned to it won』t notice. So, you become sensitive to luck.

第三種方法是你變得非常善於發現運氣。如果你在某一領域非常熟練，你會注意到在你的領域中發生幸運的機會，而其他不熟悉它的人不會注意到。所以，你對運氣變得敏感。

The last kind of luck is the weirdest, hardest kind, where you build a unique character, a unique brand, a unique mindset, which causes luck to find you.

最後一種運氣是最奇怪、最艱難的一種，你會建立一個獨特的性格、獨特的品牌、獨特的心態，這會讓運氣來找你。

For example, let』s say you』re the best person in the world at deep -sea diving. You』re known to take on deep -sea dives nobody else will even dare to attempt. By sheer luck, somebody finds a sunken treasure ship off the coast they can』t get to. Well, their luck just became your luck, because they』re going to come to you to get to the treasure, and you』re going to get paid for it.

例如，假設你是世界上最擅長深海潛水的人。大家都知道你會進行深海潛水，其他人甚至都不敢嘗試。幸運的是，有人在離海岸不遠的地方發現了一艘沉沒的寶船，他們無法到達那裡。嗯，他們的運氣就變成了你的運氣，因為他們會來找你拿到寶藏，而你會為此得到報酬。

This is an extreme example, but it shows how one person had blind luck finding the treasure. Them coming to you to extract it and give you half is not blind luck. You created your own luck. You put yourself in a position to capitalize on luck or to attract luck when nobody else created the opportunity for themselves. To get rich without getting lucky, we want to be deterministic. We don』t want to leave it to chance. [78]

這是一個極端的例子，但它顯示了一個人是如何盲目地幸運地找到了寶藏的。他們來找你提取並給你一半不是盲目的運氣。你創造了你自己的運氣。當沒有人為自己創造機會時，你把自己放在利用運氣或吸引運氣的位置上。要想在不需走運的情況下致富，我們要有決定論的態度。我們不想讓它聽天由命。「[78]

Ways to get lucky:

幸運之道：

• Hope luck finds you.祝你好運降臨。
• Hustle until you stumble into it. 忙碌到你跌跌撞撞地走進去。
• Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances others miss. 做好思想準備，對其他人錯過的機會保持敏感。
• Become the best at what you do. Refine what you do until this is true. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny. 成為你所做的事情中的佼佼者。改進你所做的直到這是真的。機會會來找你的。運氣就是你的命運。

It starts becoming so deterministic, it stops being luck. The definition starts fading from luck to destiny. To summarize the fourth type: build your character in a certain way, then your character becomes your destiny.

它開始變得如此確定，它不再是運氣。這個定義開始從運氣淡出到命運。總結第四種類型：以某種方式塑造你的性格，那麼你的性格就成了你的命運。

One of the things I think is important to make money is having a reputation that makes people do deals through you. Remember the example of being a great diver where treasure hunters will come and give you a piece of the treasure for your diving skills.

我認為賺錢最重要的一件事是擁有讓人們通過你進行交易的聲譽。記住一個偉大的潛水員的例子，在那裡尋寶者會來給你一塊寶藏來獎勵你的潛水技能。

If you are a trusted, reliable, high -integrity , long -term -thinking dealmaker, when other people want to do deals but don』t know how to do them in a trustworthy manner with strangers, they will literally approach you and give you a cut of the deal just because of the integrity and reputation you』ve built up.

如果你是一個值得信任的、可靠的、高度正直的、有長遠思維的交易撮合者，當其他人想做交易，但不知道如何與陌生人以值得信賴的方式進行交易時，他們真的會接近你，僅僅因為你建立的誠信和聲譽，他們就會給你分一杯羹。

Warren Buffett gets offered deals to buy companies, buy warrants, bail out banks, and do things other people can』t do because of his reputation. Of course, he has accountability on the line, and he has a strong brand on the line.

沃倫·巴菲特(Warren Buffett)得到了收購公司、購買認股權證、救助銀行以及做其他人因為他的聲譽而做不到的事情的交易。當然，他線上路上有責任，線上路上有強大的品牌。

Your character and your reputation are things you can build, which will let you take advantage of opportunities other people may characterize as lucky, but you know it wasn』t luck. [78] My co -founder Nivi said, 「In a long -term game, it seems that everybody is making each other rich. And in a short -term game, it seems like everybody is making themselves rich.」

你的性格和聲譽是你可以建立的，這會讓你利用別人可能認為是幸運的機會，但你知道這不是運氣。「[78]我的聯合創始人尼維說，」在長期的遊戲中，似乎每個人都在讓彼此致富。而在短期博弈中，似乎每個人都在讓自己致富。「

I think that is a brilliant formulation. In a long -term game, it』s positive sum. We』re all baking the pie together. We』re trying to make it as big as possible. And in a short -term game, we』re cutting up the pie. [78]

我認為這是一個很棒的提法。在長期博弈中，它是正和。我們都在一起烤餡餅。我們在努力把它做得儘可能大。在一個短期的遊戲中，我們正在切餡餅。

How important is networking?
網路有多重要？

I think business networking is a complete waste of time. And I know there are people and companies popularizing this concept because it serves them and their business model well, but the reality is if you』re building something interesting, you will always have more people who will want to know you. Trying to build business relationships well in advance of doing business is a complete waste of time. I have a much more comfortable philosophy: 「Be a maker who makes something interesting people want. Show your craft, practice your craft, and the right people will eventually find you.」 [14]

我認為商務社交完全是浪費時間。我知道有些人和公司普及這一概念，因為它很好地服務於他們和他們的商業模式，但現實是，如果你正在建設一些有趣的東西，你總是會有更多的人想要了解你。試圖在做生意之前很好地建立業務關係完全是浪費時間。我有一個更舒適的哲學：「做一個能製造出人們想要的有趣東西的製造者。展示你的手藝，練習你的手藝，合適的人最終會找到你。「
And once you』ve met someone, how do you determine if you can trust someone? What signals do you pay attention to?

一旦你遇到了某人，你如何確定你是否可以信任某人呢？你會注意哪些訊號？

If someone is talking a lot about how honest they are, they』re probably dishonest. That is just a little telltale indicator I』ve learned. When someone spends too much time talking about their own values or they』re talking themselves up, they』re covering for something. [4]

如果有人喋喋不休地說他們有多誠實，那麼他們很可能是不誠實的。這只是我學到的一個小小的指示器。當某人花太多時間談論他們自己的價值觀，或者他們在自吹自擂時，他們是在掩飾什麼。

Sharks eat well but live a life surrounded by sharks.

鯊魚吃得很好，但是生活在鯊魚的包圍之中。

I have great people in my life who are extremely successful, very desirable (like everybody wants to be their friend), very smart. Yet, I』ve seen them do one or two things slightly not great to other people. The first time, I』ll say, 「Hey, I don』t think you should do this to that other person. Not because you won』t get away with it. You will get away with it, but because it will hurt you in the end.」

我的生活中有非常成功、非常令人嚮往(就像每個人都想成為他們的朋友)、非常聰明的偉人。然而，我看到他們做了一兩件對其他人不太好的事情。第一次，我會說，「嘿，我認為你不應該這樣對另一個人。不是因為你不會逍遙法外。你會逍遙法外，但因為它最終會傷害你。「

Not in some cosmic, karma kind of way, but I believe deep down we all know who we are. You cannot hide anything from yourself. Your own failures are written within your psyche, and they are obvious to you. If you have too many of these moral shortcomings, you will not respect yourself. The worst outcome in this world is not having self -esteem . If you don』t love yourself, who will?

不是以某種宇宙的、因果報應的方式，但我相信在內心深處我們都知道自己是誰。你不能對自己隱瞞任何事。你自己的失敗寫在你的心靈里，它們對你來說是顯而易見的。如果你有太多這樣的道德缺陷，你就不會尊重自己。這個世界上最糟糕的結果就是沒有自尊。如果你不愛自己，誰會呢？
I think you just have to be very careful about doing things you are fundamentally not going to be proud of, because they will damage you. The first time someone acts this way, I will warn them. By the way, nobody changes. Then I just distance myself from them. I cut them out of my life. I just have this saying inside my head: 「The closer you want to get to me, the better your values have to be.」 [4]
我認為你只需要非常小心地做一些你根本不會引以為豪的事情，因為它們會傷害你。第一次有人這樣做，我會警告他們。順便說一下，沒有人會改變。然後我就和他們保持距離。我把他們從我的生活中剔除。我腦子裡只有一句話：「你越想接近我，你的價值觀就必須越好。」
