# Find a Position of Leverage

找到一個有槓桿作用的位置

We live in an age of infinite leverage, and the economic rewards for genuine intellectual curiosity have never been higher. [11] Following your genuine intellectual curiosity is a better foundation for a career than following whatever is making money right now. [11]

我們生活在一個擁有無限槓桿的時代，真正的求知慾所帶來的經濟回報從未像現在這樣高過。追隨你真正的求知慾比追隨當下能賺錢的東西更能為職業打下更好的基礎。

Knowledge only you know or only a small set of people knows is going to come out of your passions and your hobbies, oddly enough. If you have hobbies around your intellectual curiosity, you』re more likely to develop these passions. [1]

奇怪的是，只有你知道的知識或者只有一小部分人知道的知識會來自你的熱情和愛好。如果你對自己的求知慾有興趣，你就更有可能培養這些激情。

If it entertains you now but will bore you someday, it』s a distraction. Keep looking.

如果它現在讓你開心，但有一天會讓你厭煩，那就是讓你分心。繼續找。

I only really want to do things for their own sake. That is one definition of art. Whether it』s business, exercise, romance, friendship, whatever, I think the meaning of life is to do things for their own sake. Ironically, when you do things for their own sake, you create your best work. Even if you』re just trying to make money, you will actually be the most successful.

我真的只想為自己著想。這是藝術的一個定義。無論是生意、鍛鍊、浪漫還是友誼，我認為人生的意義就是為自己做事。具有諷刺意味的是，當你為他們自己做事時，你創造了你最好的作品。即使你只是想賺錢，實際上你也會是最成功的。

The year I generated the most wealth for myself was actually the year I worked the least hard and cared the least about the future. I was mostly doing things for the sheer fun of it. I was basically telling people, 「I』m retired, I』m not working.」 Then, I had the time for whatever was my highest valued project in front of me. By doing things for their own sake, I did them at their best. [74]

我為自己創造最多財富的那一年，實際上也是我最不努力工作、最不關心未來的一年。我做這些事主要是爲了純粹的樂趣。我基本上是在告訴人們，「我退休了，我不工作了。」然後，我有時間做擺在我面前的任何我最看重的專案。通過為他們自己做事，我盡了最大努力。「[74]

The less you want something, the less you』re thinking about it, the less you』re obsessing over it, the more you』re going to do it in a natural way. The more you』re going to do it for yourself. You』re going to do it in a way you』re good at, and you』re going to stick with it. The people around you will see the quality of your work is higher. [1]

你想要的東西越少，你想的就越少，你對它的執著就越少，你就會更自然地去做它。你就越想為自己做這件事。你要用你擅長的方式去做，並且要堅持下去。你周圍的人會看到你的工作質量更高。

Follow your intellectual curiosity more than whatever is 「hot」 right now. If your curiosity ever leads you to a place where society eventually wants to go, you』ll get paid extremely well. [3]

更多地追隨你的求知慾，而不是現在任何「熱門」的東西。如果你的好奇心曾經把你帶到一個社會最終想去的地方，你會得到非常豐厚的報酬。

You』re more likely to have skills society does not yet know how to train other people to do. If someone can train other people how to do something, then they can replace you. If they can replace you, then they don』t have to pay you a lot. You want to know how to do something other people don』t know how to do at the time period when those skills are in demand. [1]

你更有可能擁有社會還不知道如何訓練其他人去做的技能。如果有人能訓練別人怎麼做，那麼他們就能取代你。如果他們能取代你，那麼他們就不必付給你很多錢。你想知道如何在需要這些技能的時候做別人不知道該怎麼做的事情。

If they can train you to do it, then eventually they will train a computer to do it.

如果他們能訓練你做這件事，那麼最終他們會訓練一臺計算機去做這件事。

You get rewarded by society for giving it what it wants and doesn』t know how to get elsewhere. A lot of people think you can go to school and study for how to make money, but the reality is, there』s no skill called 「business.」 [1]

你得到了社會的獎勵，因為你給了它想要的東西，而不知道如何從其他地方得到。很多人認為你可以去學校學習如何賺錢，但現實是，沒有什麼技能叫做「生意」。

Think about what product or service society wants but does not yet know how to get. You want to become the person who delivers it and delivers it at scale. That is really the challenge of how to make money.

想一想社會想要什麼產品或服務，但還不知道如何獲得。你想成為交付它的人，並按規模交付它。這確實是如何賺錢的挑戰。

Now, the problem is becoming good at whatever 「it」 is. It moves around from generation to generation, but a lot of it happens to be in technology.

現在，無論「它」是什麼，問題都變得很好了。它代代相傳，但其中很多恰好是在技術領域。

You are waiting for your moment when something emerges in the world, they need a skill set, and you』re uniquely qualified. You build your brand in the meantime on Twitter, on YouTube, and by giving away free work. You make a name for yourself, and you take some risk in the process. When it is time to move on the opportunity, you can do so with leverage—the maximum leverage possible. [1]

你在等待你的時刻，世界上出現了一些東西，他們需要一套技能，而你是獨一無二的合格人才。在此期間，你可以在Twitter、YouTube和免費作品上建立自己的品牌。你讓自己聲名鵲起，在這個過程中你承擔了一些風險。當是時候抓住機會時，你可以用槓桿-儘可能的最大槓桿-來做到這一點。


There are three broad classes of leverage:
槓桿分為三大類：

One form of leverage is labor— other humans working for you. It is the oldest form of leverage, and actually not a great one in the modern world. [1] I would argue this is the worst form of leverage that you could possibly use. Managing other people is incredibly messy. It requires tremendous leadership skills. You』re one short hop from a mutiny or getting eaten or torn apart by the mob. [78]

一種槓桿形式是勞動--其他為你工作的人。這是最古老的槓桿形式，實際上在現代世界中並不是一種偉大的槓桿形式。[1]我認為這是你可能使用的最糟糕的槓桿形式。管理其他人是一件令人難以置信的雜亂無章的事情。這需要極強的領導能力。你離兵變或被暴徒吃掉或撕裂只有一步之遙。

Money is good as a form of leverage. It means every time you make a decision, you multiply it with money. [1] Capital is a trickier form of leverage to use. It』s more modern. It』s the one that people have used to get fabulously wealthy in the last century. It』s probably been the dominant form of leverage in the last century.

錢作為一種槓桿是好的。這意味著你每做一次決定，你就會把它與金錢相乘。)[1]資本是一種更難使用的槓桿形式。它更現代一些。在上個世紀，人們用它來獲得驚人的財富。在上個世紀，它可能一直是占主導地位的槓桿形式。

You can see this by looking for the richest people. It』s bankers, politicians in corrupt countries who print money, essentially people who move large amounts of money around. If you look at the top of very large companies, outside of technology companies, in many, many large old companies, the CEO job is really a financial job.

你可以通過尋找最富有的人來看到這一點。是銀行家、腐敗國家的政客印製鈔票，本質上是轉移大量鈔票的人。如果你看看非常大的公司的高層，除了科技公司，在很多很多大型的老公司中，執行長的工作實際上是一項金融工作。

It scales very, very well. If you get good at managing capital, you can manage more and more capital much more easily than you can manage more and more people. [78]

它的伸縮性非常非常好。如果你善於管理資本，你管理越來越多的資本就比管理越來越多的人容易得多。「[78]

The final form of leverage is brand new—the most democratic form. It is: 「products with no marginal cost of replication.」 This includes books, media, movies, and code. Code is probably the most powerful form of permissionless leverage. All you need is a computer—you don』t need anyone』s permission. [1]

槓桿的最終形式是全新的--最民主的形式。它是：「沒有邊際複製成本的產品。」這包括書籍、媒體、電影和程式碼。程式碼可能是最強大的未經許可的槓桿形式。你所需要的只是一臺電腦--你不需要任何人的許可。

Forget rich versus poor, white -collar versus blue. It』s now leveraged versus un -leveraged .
忘了富人和窮人、白領和藍領吧。現在，它是槓桿化的，而不是非槓桿化的。

The most interesting and the most important form of leverage is the idea of products that have no marginal cost of replication. This is the new form of leverage. This was only invented in the last few hundred years. It started with the printing press. It accelerated with broadcast media, and now it』s really blown up with the internet and with coding. Now, you can multiply your efforts without involving other humans and without needing money from other humans.

最有趣和最重要的槓桿形式是沒有邊際複製成本的產品的想法。這就是新的槓桿形式。這是近幾百年來才發明的。它始於印刷機。它隨著廣播媒體的發展而加速，現在它真的隨著網際網路和編碼而爆炸。現在，你可以在不涉及其他人的情況下加倍努力，也不需要其他人的錢。

This book is a form of leverage. Long ago, I would have had to sit in a lecture hall and lecture each of you personally. I would have maybe reached a few hundred people, and that would have been that. [78]

這本書是一種槓桿。很久以前，我必須坐在演講廳里親自給你們每個人講課。我可能會接觸到幾百人，那就是這樣。「[78]
This newest form of leverage is where all the new fortunes are made, all the new billionaires. For the last generation, fortunes were made by capital. The people who made fortunes were the Warren Buffetts of the world.

這種最新形式的槓桿是所有新財富、所有新億萬富翁的發源地。在上一代人中，財富是由資本創造的。發家致富的人是世界上的沃倫·巴菲特(Warren Buffetts)。

But the new generation』s fortunes are all made through code or media. Joe Rogan making $50 million to $100 million a year from his podcast. You』re going to have PewDiePie. I don』t know how much money he』s rolling in, but he』s bigger than the news. And of course, there』s Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs. Their wealth is all code -based leverage. [78]

但新一代的財富都是通過程式碼或媒體創造的。喬·羅根(Joe Rogan)每年從他的播客中賺取5000萬至1億美元。你要吃PewDiePie。我不知道他賺了多少錢，但他比新聞更重要。當然，還有傑夫·貝佐斯、馬克·扎克伯格、拉里·佩奇、謝爾蓋·布林、比爾·蓋茨和史蒂夫·喬布斯。他們的財富都是基於程式碼的槓桿。

Probably the most interesting thing to keep in mind about new forms of leverage is they are permissionless. They don』t require somebody else』s permission for you to use them or succeed. For labor leverage, somebody has to decide to follow you. For capital leverage, somebody has to give you money to invest or to turn into a product.

關於新的槓桿形式，最有趣的可能是它們是未經許可的。它們不需要別人的許可，您就可以使用它們或取得成功。對於勞動力槓桿，必須有人決定追隨你。對於資本槓桿，必須有人給你錢來投資或轉化為產品。

Coding, writing books, recording podcasts, tweeting, YouTubing—these kinds of things are permissionless. You don』t need anyone』s permission to do them, and that』s why they are very egalitarian. They』re great equalizers of leverage. [78] Every great software developer, for example, now has an army of robots working for him at nighttime while he or she sleeps, after they』ve written the code, and it』s cranking away. [78]

編碼、寫書、錄製播客、發推特、YouTube--這些事情都是未經許可的。你不需要任何人的許可就可以這麼做，這就是為什麼他們非常平等主義的原因。他們是很好的槓桿均衡器。例如，現在每個偉大的軟件開發人員，現在都有一支機器人大軍，在他或她睡覺的時候，在他們寫完程式碼后，為他工作，而且它正在轉動。

You』re never going to get rich renting out your time.
把你的時間租出去，你永遠不會發財的。

Whenever you can in life, optimize for independence rather than pay. If you have independence and you』re accountable on your output, as opposed to your input—that』s the dream. [10]
在生活中，只要你能做到這一點，就優化你的獨立性，而不是付錢。如果你有獨立性，對你的產出負責，而不是對你的投入負責--這就是你的夢想。

Humans evolved in societies where there was no leverage. If I was chopping wood or carrying water for you, you knew eight hours put in would be equal to about eight hours of output. Now we』ve invented leverage—through capital, cooperation, technology, productivity, all these means. We live in an age of leverage. As a worker, you want to be as leveraged as possible so you have a huge impact without as much time or physical effort.

人類是在沒有籌碼的社會中進化的。如果我為你劈柴或提水，你就知道投入八個小時就相當於產出八個小時。現在我們發明了槓桿-通過資本、合作、技術、生產力，所有這些手段。我們生活在一個槓桿化的時代。作為一名員工，你想要儘可能地發揮槓桿作用，這樣你就可以在沒有太多時間或體力的情況下產生巨大的影響。

A leveraged worker can out -produce a non -leveraged worker by a factor of one thousand or ten thousand. With a leveraged worker, judgment is far more important than how much time they put in or how hard they work.

槓桿工人的產量可能比非槓桿工人高出一千倍或一萬倍。對於槓桿員工來說，判斷比他們投入了多少時間或工作有多努力要重要得多。

Forget 10x programmers. 1,000x programmers really exist, we just don』t fully acknowledge it. See @ID_AA_Carmack, @notch, Satoshi Nakomoto, etc.
忘了10倍的程式設計師吧。1000x程式設計師確實存在，只是我們沒有完全認識到而已。參見@ID_AA_CAMMACK、@NOTCH、中本聰等。

For example, a good software engineer, just by writing the right little piece of code and creating the right little application, can literally create half a billion dollars』 worth of value for a company. But ten engineers working ten times as hard, just because they choose the wrong model, the wrong product, wrote it the wrong way, or put in the wrong viral loop, have basically wasted their time. Inputs don』t match outputs, especially for leveraged workers.

例如，一個優秀的軟體工程師，僅僅通過編寫正確的小程式碼和建立正確的小應用程式，就可以真正為一家公司創造5億美元的價值。但是十位工程師付出了十倍的努力，僅僅因為他們選擇了錯誤的型號，錯誤的產品，錯誤的書寫方式，或者進入了錯誤的病毒式循環，基本上就浪費了他們的時間。輸入與輸出不匹配，特別是對於槓桿工人而言。

What you want in life is to be in control of your time. You want to get into a leveraged job where you control your own time and you』re tracked on the outputs. If you do something incredible to move the needle on the business, they have to pay you. Especially if they don』t know how you did it because it』s innate to your obsession or your skill or your innate abilities, they』re going to have to keep paying you to do it.

你在生活中想要的是控制你的時間。你想要進入一份槓桿工作，在那裡你可以控制自己的時間，並且你的輸出會被跟蹤。如果你做了令人難以置信的事情，他們必須付錢給你。特別是如果他們不知道你是如何做到這一點的，因為這是你的癡迷、你的技能或你天生的能力，他們將不得不繼續付錢讓你做這件事。

If you have specific knowledge, you have accountability and you have leverage; they have to pay you what you』re worth. If they pay you what you』re worth, then you can get your time back—you can be hyper -efficient . You』re not doing meetings for meetings』 sake, you』re not trying to impress other people, you』re not writing things down to make it look like you did work. All you care about is the actual work itself.

如果你有具體的知識，你就有責任，你有槓桿；他們必須按你的價值付給你。如果他們付給你應得的報酬，那麼你就可以拿回你的時間--你可以變得超級高效。你不是爲了開會而開會，你不是爲了給別人留下深刻印象，你不是爲了讓人覺得你確實在工作而把事情寫下來。你所關心的只是實際工作本身。

When you do just the actual work itself, you』ll be far more productive, far more efficient. You』ll work when you feel like it—when you』re high -energy —and you won』t be trying to struggle through when you』re low energy. You』ll gain your time back.

當你只做實際的工作時，你會有更多的生產力和更高的效率。當你精力充沛的時候，你會在你想工作的時候工作，而當你精力充沛的時候，你就不會試圖掙扎著度過難關。你會拿回你的時間的。

Forty hour work weeks are a relic of the Industrial Age. Knowledge workers function like athletes—train and sprint, then rest and reassess.

每週工作40小時是工業時代的遺蹟。知識型員工的功能就像運動員一樣--訓練和衝刺，然後休息和重新評估。

Sales is an example—especially very high -end sales. If you』re a real estate agent out there selling houses, it』s not a great job, necessarily. It』s very crowded. But if you』re a top -tier real estate agent, you know how to market yourself and you know how to sell houses, it』s possible you could sell $5 million mansions in one tenth of the time while somebody else is struggling to sell $100,000 apartments or condos. Real estate agent is a job with input and output disconnected.
銷售就是一個例子，特別是非常高階的銷售。如果你是一名房地產經紀人，在外面賣房子，這不一定是一份很好的工作。非常擁擠。但如果你是一名頂級房地產經紀人，你知道如何推銷自己，知道如何賣房子，你可能會在十分之一的時間裡賣出500萬美元的豪宅，而其他人卻在努力賣出10萬美元的公寓或公寓。房地產經紀人是一種投入產出脫節的工作。

Building any product and selling any product fits this description. And fundamentally, what else is there? Where you don』t necessarily want to be is a support role, like customer service. In customer service, unfortunately, inputs and outputs relate relatively close to each other, and the hours you put in matter. [10]
構建任何產品和銷售任何產品都符合這一描述。從根本上說，還有什麼呢？你不一定想做的是支援角色，比如客戶服務。不幸的是，在客戶服務中，投入和產出的關係相對密切，你投入的時間很重要。

Tools and leverage create this disconnection between inputs and outputs. The higher the creativity component of a profession, the more likely it is to have disconnected inputs and outputs. If you』re looking at professions where your inputs and your outputs are highly connected, it』s going to be very hard to create wealth and make wealth for yourself in that process. [78]
工具和槓桿造成了輸入和輸出之間的這種脫節。一個職業的創造力成分越高，其投入和產出脫節的可能性就越大。如果你看的是那些你的投入和產出高度相關的職業，那麼在這個過程中為自己創造財富併爲自己創造財富將是非常困難的。「[78]
If you want to be part of a great tech company, then you need to be able to SELL or BUILD. If you don』t do either, learn.

如果你想成為一家偉大的科技公司的一部分，那麼你需要能夠出售或建立。如果你兩者都不做，那就學習吧。

Learn to sell, learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.
學會銷售，學會建造。如果你兩個都能做到，你就勢不可擋了。

These are two very broad categories. One is building the product. This is hard, and it』s multivariate. It can include design; it can include development; it can include manufacturing, logistics, procurement; and it can even be designing and operating a service. It has many, many definitions.

這是兩個非常廣泛的類別。一個是製造產品。這很難，而且是多元的。它可以包括設計；可以包括開發；可以包括製造、物流、採購；甚至可以是設計和運營服務。它有很多很多的定義。

But in every industry, there is a definition of the builder. In our tech industry, it』s the CTO, it』s the programmer, it』s the software engineer or hardware engineer. But even in the laundry business, it could be the person who』s building the laundry service, who is making the trains run on time, who』s making sure all the clothes end up in the right place at the right time, and so on.
但在每個行業，都有對建造者的定義。在我們的技術行業中，它是技術長，它是程式設計師，它是軟體工程師或硬體工程師。但即使是在洗衣業，也可能是建立洗衣服務的人，讓火車準時執行的人，確保所有衣服在正確的時間到達正確的地點的人，等等。

The other side of it is sales. Again, selling has a very broad definition. Selling doesn』t necessarily just mean selling to individual customers, but it can mean marketing, it can mean communicating, it can mean recruiting, it can mean raising money, it can mean inspiring people, it could mean doing PR. It』s a broad umbrella category. [78]
它的另一面是銷售。同樣，銷售的定義非常寬泛。銷售不一定意味著向個人客戶銷售，但它可以是營銷，可以是溝通，可以是招聘，可以是籌集資金，可以是鼓舞人心，也可以是做公關。這是一個寬泛的傘形類別。

Earn with your mind, not your time.

用你的頭腦而不是你的時間來掙錢。

Let』s talk more about the real estate business. The worst kind of job is someone who』s doing labor to repair a house. Maybe you get paid ten dollars or twenty dollars an hour. You go to people』s houses, your boss demands you』re there at 8:00 a.m., and you repair your piece of the house. Here, you have zero leverage. You have some accountability, but not really, because your accountability is to your boss, not to the client. You don』t have any real specific knowledge, since what you』re doing is labor lots of people can do. You』re not going to get paid a lot. You』re getting paid minimum wage plus a little bit for your skill and your time.

讓我們更多地談談房地產業務吧。最糟糕的工作是一個人在做修繕房子的勞動。也許你的工資是每小時10美元或20美元。你去別人家裡，你的老闆要求你早上8點到那裡，然後你修理房子的一部分。在這裡，你沒有槓桿。你有一些責任，但不是真的，因為你的責任是對你的老闆，而不是對客戶。你沒有任何真正的專門知識，因為你所做的是很多人都能做的勞動。你不會拿到很多錢的。你可以拿到最低工資，外加一點作為你的技能和時間的報酬。

The next level up might be the general contractor working on the house for the owner. They may be getting paid $50,000 to do the whole project, then they』re paying the labor fifteen dollars an hour and they』re keeping the difference.

下一層可能是為業主修繕房屋的總承包商。他們完成整個專案可能會得到5萬美元的報酬，然後他們付給工人每小時15美元，他們會保留差額。

A general contractor is obviously a better place to be. But how do we measure it? How do we know it』s better? Well, we know it』s better because this person has some accountability. They』re responsible for the outcome, they have to sweat at night if things aren』t working. Contractors have leverage through laborers working for them. They also have little bit more specific knowledge: how to organize a team, make them show up on time, and how to deal with city regulations.

總承包商顯然是一個更好的選擇。但是我們如何衡量它呢？我們怎麼知道這樣更好呢？嗯，我們知道這樣更好，因為這個人有一定的責任感。他們要對結果負責，如果事情不順利，他們必須在晚上出汗。承包商通過為他們工作的勞工擁有影響力。他們也有一些更具體的知識：如何組織團隊，讓他們準時出現，以及如何處理城市規定。

The next level up might be a real estate developer. A developer is someone who』s going to buy a property, hire a bunch of contractors, and transform it into something higher value. They probably have to take out a loan to buy a house or go to investors to raise money. They buy the old house, tear it down, rebuild it, and sell it. Instead of $50,000 like the general contractor, or fifteen dollars an hour like the laborer, the developer might be able to make a million dollars or half a million dollars in profit when they sell the house for more than they bought it for, including the expenses of construction. But now, notice what is required from the developer: a very high level of accountability.

下一層可能是房地產開發商。開發商是這樣的人，他們打算購買一處房產，僱傭一群承包商，然後把它改造成更高價值的東西。他們可能不得不貸款買房，或者去找投資者融資。他們買下這座老房子，拆掉它，重建它，然後把它賣了。開發商不像總承包商那樣是5萬美元，也不是像工人那樣每小時15美元，而是當他們以高於購買價格的價格出售房屋時，包括建築費用在內，他們可能能夠賺取100萬美元或50萬美元的利潤。但是現在，請注意對開發人員的要求：非常高級別的責任。

The developer takes on more risk, more accountability, has more leverage, and needs to have more specific knowledge. They need to understand fundraising, city regulations, where the real estate market is headed, and whether they should take the risk or not. It is more difficult.

開發人員承擔更多風險，承擔更多責任，擁有更多槓桿，需要有更具體的知識。他們需要了解資金籌集、城市法規、房地產市場的走向，以及他們是否應該承擔風險。這就更難了。

The next level up might be someone who』s managing money in a real estate fund. They have an enormous amount of capital leverage. They』re dealing with lots and lots of developers, and they』re buying huge amounts of housing inventory. [74]
下一級可能是在房地產基金管理資金的人。他們擁有巨大的資本槓桿。他們正在與許許多多的開發商打交道，他們正在購買大量的房屋庫存。

One level beyond that might be somebody who says, 「Actually, I want to bring the maximum leverage to bear in this market and the maximum specific knowledge.」 That person would say, 「Well, I understand real estate, and I understand everything from basic housing construction, to building properties and selling them, to how real estate markets move and thrive, and I also understand the technology business. I understand how to recruit developers, how to write code, and how to build a good product, and I understand how to raise money from venture capitalists, how to return it, and how all of that works.」

更高一層的人可能會說，「實際上，我想在這個市場上發揮最大的槓桿作用和最大的具體知識。」那個人會說，「嗯，我瞭解房地產，我瞭解一切，從基本的住房建設，到建造和出售房產，再到房地產市場是如何運作和繁榮的，我也瞭解科技行業。我知道如何招募開發人員，如何編寫程式碼，如何打造一個好的產品，我也知道如何從風險投資家那裡籌集資金，如何返還資金，以及所有這些都是如何運作的。「

Obviously, not a single person may know this. You may pull a team together to do it where each have different skill sets, but that combined entity would have specific knowledge in technology and in real estate. It would have massive accountability because that company』s name would be a very high -risk , high -reward effort attached to the whole thing, and people would devote their lives to it and take on significant risk. It would have leverage in code with lots of developers. It would have capital with investors putting money in and the founder』s own capital. It would have some of the highest -quality labor you can find, which is high -quality engineers, designers, and marketers who are working on the company.

顯然，沒有一個人知道這一點。你可以召集一個團隊來做這件事，每個團隊都有不同的技能集，但合併后的實體將在技術和房地產方面擁有特定的知識。它將承擔巨大的責任，因為該公司的名稱將是一個非常高風險，高回報的努力，整個事情，人們會獻身於它，並承擔重大風險。它將在大量開發人員的程式碼中發揮槓桿作用。它將擁有投資者投入的資本和創始人的自有資本。它將擁有一些你能找到的最高質量的勞動力，即在公司工作的高素質工程師、設計師和營銷人員。

Then, you may end up with a Trulia, Redfin, or Zillow company, and then the upside could potentially be in the billions of dollars, or the hundreds of millions of dollars. [78]
然後，你可能會得到一家Trulia，Redfin或Zillow公司，然後潛在的收益可能是數十億美元，或者數億美元。

Each level has increasing leverage, increasing accountability, increasingly specific knowledge. You』re adding in money -based leverage on top of labor -based leverage. Adding in code -based leverage on top of money and labor allows you to actually create something bigger and bigger and get closer and closer to owning all the upside, not just being paid a salary.

每一級都有越來越多的槓桿作用，越來越多的責任，越來越具體的知識。你在勞動力槓桿的基礎上增加了貨幣槓桿。在金錢和勞動力的基礎上增加基於程式碼的槓桿，可以讓你真正創造出越來越大的東西，並越來越接近擁有所有的好處，而不僅僅是拿到工資。

You start as a salaried employee. But you want to work your way up to try and get higher leverage, more accountability, and specific knowledge. The combination of those over a long period of time with the magic of compound interest will make you wealthy. [74]
你是從一名受薪員工開始的。但你要努力向上，嘗試獲得更高的槓桿率、更多的責任感和具體的知識。長期來看，這些與複利的魔力相結合，會讓你變得富有。

The one thing you have to avoid is the risk of ruin.

你必須避免的一件事是破產的風險。

Avoiding ruin means stay out of jail. So, don』t do anything illegal. It』s never worth it to wear an orange jumpsuit. Stay out of total catastrophic loss. Avoiding ruin could also mean you stay out of things that could be physically dangerous or hurt your body. You have to watch your health.
避免毀滅意味著遠離牢獄之災。所以，不要做任何違法的事。穿橙色連體褲從來都不值得。遠離全部的災難性損失。避免毀滅也可能意味著你遠離那些可能對身體造成危險或傷害身體的事情。你必須注意你的健康。

Stay out of things that could cause you to lose all of your capital, all of your savings. Don』t gamble everything on one go. Instead, take rationally optimistic bets with big upsides. [78]
不要插手那些可能會讓你損失所有資本、所有積蓄的事情。不要把所有的東西都賭上一次。取而代之的是，採取理性樂觀的押注，並有很大的上行空間。
