# Take on Accountability

承擔責任

Embrace accountability and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.

接受責任，以自己的名義承擔業務風險。社會會用責任、公平和槓桿來獎勵你。

To get rich, you need leverage. Leverage comes in labor, comes in capital, or it can come through code or media. But most of these, like labor and capital, people have to give to you. For labor, somebody has to follow you. For capital, somebody has to give you money, assets to manage, or machines.

要想致富，你需要籌碼。槓桿可以來自勞動力，也可以來自資本，也可以通過程式碼或媒體來實現。但是大多數這些東西，比如勞動力和資本，人們都必須給你。至於分娩，總得有人跟著你。對於資本，必須有人給你錢、要管理的資產或機器。

So to get these things, you have to build credibility, and you have to do it under your own name as much as possible, which is risky. So, accountability is a double -edged thing. It allows you to take credit when things go well and to bear the brunt of the failure when things go badly. [78]

因此，要得到這些東西，你必須建立信譽，而且你必須儘可能以自己的名義去做，這是有風險的。因此，問責是一件雙刃劍。它讓你在事情進展順利的時候獲得榮譽，在事情變得糟糕的時候首當其衝地承受失敗的衝擊。「[78]

Clear accountability is important. Without accountability, you don』t have incentives. Without accountability, you can』t build credibility. But you take risks. You risk failure. You risk humiliation. You risk failure under your own name.

明確的問責很重要。沒有責任，你就沒有激勵。沒有責任，你就不能建立信譽。但是你要承擔風險。你冒著失敗的風險。你冒著丟臉的風險。你以自己的名義冒著失敗的風險。

Luckily, in modern society, there』s no more debtors』 prison and people aren』t imprisoned or executed for losing other people』s money, but we』re still socially hardwired to not fail in public under our own names. The people who have the ability to fail in public under their own names actually gain a lot of power.

幸運的是，在現代社會，不再有債務人的監獄，人們不會因為損失別人的錢而被監禁或處決，但我們仍然在社會上根深蒂固，不會以自己的名義在公共場合失敗。那些有能力以自己的名義在公共場合失敗的人實際上獲得了很大的權力。

I』ll give a personal anecdote. Up until about 2013, 2014, my public persona was entirely around startups and investing. Only around 2014, 2015 did I start talking about philosophy and psychological things and broader things. It made me a little nervous because I was doing it under my own name. There were definitely people in the industry who sent me messages through the backchannel like, 「What are you doing? You』re ending your career. This is stupid.」

我要講一件個人趣聞軼事。在大約2013,2014年前，我的公眾形象完全圍繞著初創企業和投資。直到2014年，2015年左右，我才開始談論哲學和心理學的東西，以及更廣泛的東西。這讓我有點緊張，因為我是以我自己的名義做的。肯定有業內人士通過秘密渠道給我發信息，比如「你在做什麼？你在結束你的職業生涯。這太愚蠢了。「

I kind of just went with it. I took a risk. Same with crypto. Early on, I took a risk. But when you put your name out there, you take a risk with certain things. You also get to reap the rewards. You get the benefits. [78]

我就是順其自然了。我冒了個險。加密也是如此。早些時候，我冒了一個險。但是當你把你的名字放在那裡的時候，你就在某些事情上冒了風險。你也能收穫回報。你會得到好處。「[78]

In the old days, the captain was expected to go down with the ship. If the ship was sinking, then literally the last person to get off was the captain. Accountability does come with real risks, but we』re talking about a business context.

在過去，人們認為船長會隨船沉沒。如果船正在下沉，那麼從字面上講，最後一個下船的人就是船長。責任確實伴隨著真正的風險，但我們談論的是商業背景。

The risk here would be you would probably be the last one to get your capital back out. You』d be the last one to get paid for your time. The time that you put in, the capital you put into the company, these are at risk. [78]

這裡的風險是，你可能是最後一個把你的資本拿回來的人。你會是最後一個拿到時間報酬的人。你投入的時間，你投入公司的資本，這些都有風險。「[78]

Realize that in modern society, the downside risk is not that large. Even personal bankruptcy can wipe the debts clean in good ecosystems. I』m most familiar with Silicon Valley, but generally, people will forgive failures as long as you were honest and made a high -integrity effort.

要認識到，在現代社會，下行風險並不是那麼大。在良好的生態系統中，即使是個人破產也可以清償債務。我對硅谷最熟悉，但一般來說，只要你誠實，做出高度正直的努力，人們就會原諒失敗。

There』s not really that much to fear in terms of failure, and so people should take on a lot more accountability than they do. [78]

就失敗而言，真的沒有那麼多可怕的事情，所以人們應該承擔比他們更多的責任。「[78]
