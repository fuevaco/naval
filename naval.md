# Now, here is Naval in his own words…

現在，這是納瓦爾用他自己的話說的…

## Background 背景

I grew up in a single -parent household with my mom working, going to school, and raising my brother and me as latchkey kids. We were very self -sufficient from a very early age. There was a lot of hardship, but everyone goes through hardship. It did help me in a number of ways.

我在一個單親家庭長大，母親工作、上學，把我和弟弟作為鑰匙孩子撫養長大。我們從很小的時候就非常自給自足。有很多困難，但每個人都經歷過困難。它確實在很多方面幫助了我。

We were poor immigrants. My dad came to the US—he was a pharmacist in India. But his degree wasn』t accepted here, so he worked in a hardware store. Not a great upbringing, you know. My family split up. [47]

我們是貧窮的移民。我父親來到美國--他是印度的一名藥劑師。但是他的學位在這裡沒有被接受，所以他在一家五金店工作。你知道，教養不是很好。我的家庭分裂了。

My mother uniquely provided, against the background of hardship, unconditional and unfailing love. If you have nothing in your life, but you have at least one person that loves you unconditionally, it』ll do wonders for your self -esteem . [8]

在艱難困苦的背景下，我的母親提供了獨一無二的、無條件的、永無止境的愛。如果你的生活中什麼都沒有，但你至少有一個人無條件地愛著你，這會給你的自尊帶來奇蹟。

We were in a part of New York City that isn』t very safe. Basically, the library was my after -school center. After I came back from school, I would just go straight to the library and hang out there until they closed. Then, I would come home. That was my daily routine. [8]

我們當時在紐約市的一個不太安全的地方。基本上，圖書館是我的課後中心。放學回來后，我會直接去圖書館，在那裡一直呆到他們關門。然後，我就會回家。那是我的日常生活。

We moved to the US when we were very young. I didn』t have many friends, so I wasn』t very confident. I spent a lot of time reading. My only real friends were books. Books make for great friends, because the best thinkers of the last few thousand years tell you their nuggets of wisdom. [8]

我們很小的時候就搬到了美國。我沒有很多朋友，所以我不是很自信。我花了很多時間讀書。我唯一真正的朋友是書。書籍造就偉大的朋友，因為過去幾千年來最好的思想家會告訴你他們的寶貴智慧。

My first job was with an illegal catering company in the back of a van delivering Indian food when I was fifteen. Even when I was younger, I had a paper route and I washed dishes in the cafeteria.

我的第一份工作是在一家非法餐飲公司工作，當時我15歲，在一輛麵包車的後座上運送印度食物。甚至在我年輕的時候，我也有送報紙的習慣，我在自助餐廳洗盤子。

I was a totally unknown kid in New York City from a nothing family, an 「immigrants trying to survive」 situation. Then, I passed the test to get into Stuyvesant High School. That saved my life, because once I had the Stuyvesant brand, I got into an Ivy League college, which led me into tech. Stuyvesant is one of those intelligence lottery situations where you can break in with instant validation. You go from being blue collar to white collar in one move. [73]

在紐約市，我是一個完全默默無聞的孩子，出身於一個一無所有的家庭，一種「試圖生存的移民」的處境。然後，我通過了考試，進入了斯圖文森高中(Stuyvesant High School)。這救了我的命，因為一旦我有了Stuyvesant品牌，我就進入了一所常春藤盟校，這讓我進入了科技行業。Stuyvesant是智慧彩票中的一種，你可以通過即時驗證進入其中。你一下子從藍領變成了白領。

At Dartmouth, I studied economics and computer science. There was a time when I thought I was going to be a PhD in economics. [8]

在達特茅斯，我學的是經濟學和電腦科學。曾經有一段時間，我以為我會成為經濟學博士。

Today, I』m an investor, personally, in about two hundred companies. Advisor to a bunch. I』m on a bunch of boards. I』m also a small partner in a cryptocurrency fund because I』m really into the potential of cryptocurrencies. I』m always cooking up something new. I always have a bunch of side projects. [4]

今天，我個人是大約200家公司的投資者。一群人的顧問。我在一堆衝浪板上。我也是一隻加密貨幣基金的小合夥人，因為我真的很喜歡加密貨幣的潛力。我總是想出一些新的東西。我總是有一堆副業。

All that, of course, in addition to being the founder and chairman of AngelList. [4]

當然，除了是AngelList的創始人和董事長之外，所有這一切都是如此。

I was born poor and miserable. I』m now pretty well -off , and I』m very happy. I worked at those.

我生來貧窮而悲慘。我現在很富裕，我很幸福。我在那裡工作過。

I』ve learned a few things, and some principles. I try to lay them out in a timeless manner, where you can figure it out for yourself. Because at the end of the day, I can』t quite teach anything. I can only inspire you and maybe give you a few hooks so you can remember. [77]

我學到了一些東西，也學到了一些原則。我試著用永恒的方式把它們擺出來，這樣你就可以自己找出答案了。因為歸根結底，我什麼都教不了。我只能激勵你，也許還能給你幾個鉤子，這樣你就能記住了。「[77]
