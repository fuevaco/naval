#  Meditation + Mental Strength
冥想+精神力量
An emotion is our evolved biology predicting the future impact of a current event. In modern settings, it』s usually exaggerated or wrong.

情緒是我們進化的生物學，預測目前事件的未來影響。在現代環境中，這通常是誇張的或錯誤的。

Why is meditation so powerful?

為什麼冥想如此強大？

Your breath is one of the few places where your autonomic nervous system meets your voluntary nervous system. It』s involuntary, but you can also control it.

你的呼吸是你的自主神經系統與你的自主神經系統相遇的少數幾個地方之一。這是非自願的，但你也可以控制它。

I think a lot of meditation practices put an emphasis on the breath because it is a gateway into your autonomic nervous system. There are many, many cases in the medical and spiritual literature of people controlling their bodies at levels that should be autonomous.

我認為很多冥想練習都把重點放在呼吸上，因為它是進入你自主神經系統的門戶。在醫學和精神文獻中，人們在應該自主的水平上控制自己的身體的情況很多，很多。

Your mind is such a powerful thing. What』s so unusual about your forebrain sending signals to your hindbrain and your hindbrain routing resources to your entire body?

你的頭腦是如此強大的東西。你的前腦向你的後腦發送訊號，而你的後腦將資源傳遞到你的整個身體，這有什麼不尋常的呢？
You can do it just by breathing. Relaxed breathing tells your body you』re safe. Then, your forebrain doesn』t need as many resources as it normally does. Now, the extra energy can be sent to your hindbrain, and it can reroute those resources to the rest of your body.

你只要呼吸就可以做到。放鬆的呼吸告訴你的身體你是安全的。這樣一來，你的前腦就不需要像平常那樣多的資源了。現在，額外的能量可以被髮送到你的後腦，它可以將這些資源重新分配到你身體的其他部位。

I』m not saying you can beat whatever illness you have just because you activated your hindbrain. But you』re devoting most of the energy normally required to care about the external environment to the immune system.

我並不是說，僅僅因為你啟用了你的後腦，你就可以戰勝你所患的任何疾病。但你把通常關心外部環境所需的大部分精力都投入到了免疫系統中。

I highly recommend listening to the Tim Ferriss』s podcast with Wim Hof. He is a walking miracle. Wim』s nickname is the Ice Man. He holds the world record for the longest time spent in an ice bath and swimming in freezing cold water. I was very inspired by him, not only because he』s capable of super -human physical feats, but because he does it while being incredibly kind and happy—which is not easy to accomplish.

我強烈推薦你和Wim Hof一起收聽Tim Ferriss的播客。他是一個活著的奇蹟。維姆的昵稱是「冰人」。他保持著在冰浴和冰冷的水中游泳的時間最長的世界紀錄。他給了我很大的啓發，不僅是因為他有能力做出超人的身體壯舉，還因為他做到了這一點，而且他非常善良和快樂-這是不容易實現的。

He advocates cold exposure, because he believes people are too separate from their natural environment. We』re constantly clothed, fed, and warm. Our bodies have lost touch with the cold. The cold is important because it can activate the immune system.

他提倡寒冷暴露，因為他認為人們與自然環境過於隔絕。我們經常穿衣、吃東西，而且很暖和。我們的身體已經與寒冷失去了聯繫。感冒很重要，因為它可以啟用免疫系統。

So, he advocates taking long ice baths. Being from the Indian subcontinent, I』m strongly against the idea of ice baths. But Wim inspired me to give cold showers a try. And I did so by using the Wim Hof breathing method. It involves hyperventilating to get more oxygen into your blood, which raises your core temperature. Then, you can go into the shower.

因此，他主張進行長時間的冰浴。作為印度次大陸人，我強烈反對冰浴的想法。但是維姆激勵我試著洗冷水澡。我使用Wim Hof呼吸法做到了這一點。它包括過度換氣，以獲得更多的氧氣進入你的血液，從而提高你的核心溫度。然後，你就可以去洗澡了。

The first few cold showers were hilarious because I』d slowly ease myself in, wincing the entire way. I started about four or five months ago. Now, I turn the shower on full -blast , and then I walk right in. I don』t give myself any time to hesitate. As soon as I hear the voice in my head telling me how cold it』s going to be, I know I have to walk in.

最初的幾個冷水澡很好笑，因為我會慢慢放鬆自己，一路上都在退縮。我大約四五個月前開始工作。現在，我把淋浴開到最大，然後我徑直走進去。我沒有給自己任何時間猶豫。當我聽到腦海中的聲音告訴我天氣會有多冷時，我知道我必須走進去。

I learned a very important lesson from this: most of our suffering comes from avoidance. Most of the suffering from a cold shower is the tip -toeing your way in. Once you』re in, you』re in. It』s not suffering. It』s just cold. Your body saying it』s cold is different than your mind saying it』s cold. Acknowledge your body saying it』s cold. Look at it. Deal with it. Accept it, but don』t mentally suffer over it. Taking a cold shower for two minutes isn』t going to kill you.

我從中學到了一個非常重要的教訓：我們的大部分痛苦都來自逃避。洗冷水澡的大部分痛苦都是腳尖著地走進去的。一旦你進去了，你就進去了。這不是痛苦。只是太冷了。你的身體說冷和你的心說冷是不同的。承認你的身體說它很冷。快看啊。處理它。接受它，但不要為它而精神痛苦。洗兩分鐘冷水澡不會要了你的命。

Having a cold shower helps you re -learn that lesson every morning. Now hot showers are just one less thing I need out of life. [2]

每天早上洗個冷水澡可以幫助你重新學習這一課。現在熱水澡只是我生活中少了一件需要的東西。

Meditation is intermittent fasting for the mind.

冥想是頭腦間歇性的禁食。

Too much sugar leads to a heavy body, and too many distractions lead to a heavy mind.

過多的糖分會導致沉重的身體，過多的分心會導致沉重的思想。

Time spent undistracted and alone, in self -examination , journaling, meditation, resolves the unresolved and takes us from mentally fat to fit.

在自我反省、寫日記、冥想中，花些時間心不在焉地獨處，可以解決懸而未決的問題，讓我們從精神上變得健康。

Do you have a current meditation practice?

你現在有冥想練習嗎？
I think meditation is like dieting, where everyone is supposedly following a regimen. Everyone says they do it, but nobody actually does it. The real set of people who meditate on a regular basis, I』ve found, are pretty rare. I』ve identified and tried at least four different forms of meditation.

我認為冥想就像節食，每個人都應該遵循一個養生法。每個人都說他們這麼做了，但實際上沒有人這麼做。我發現，真正有規律地冥想的人是相當罕見的。我已經確認並嘗試了至少四種不同形式的冥想。

The one I found works best for me is called Choiceless Awareness, or Nonjudgmental Awareness. As you』re going about your daily business (hopefully, there』s some nature) and you』re not talking to anybody else, you practice learning to accept the moment you』re in without making judgments. You don』t think, 「Oh, there』s a homeless guy over there, better cross the street」 or look at someone running by and say, 「He』s out of shape, and I』m in better shape than him.」

我發現最適合我的是「無選擇意識」，或「非評判意識」。當你在處理你的日常事務時(希望是有某種性質的)，你不會和其他任何人說話，你在練習接受你所處的時刻，而不是做出判斷。你不會想，「哦，那邊有個流浪漢，最好過馬路」，或者看著路過的人說，「他身材不好，我的身材比他好。」

If I saw a guy with a bad hair day, I would at first think 「Haha, he has a bad hair day.」 Well, why am I laughing at him to make me feel better about myself? And why am I trying to make me feel better about my own hair? Because I』m losing my hair, and I』m afraid it』s going to go away. What I find is 90 percent of thoughts I have are fear -based . The other 10 percent may be desire -based .

如果我一天看到一個頭髮不好的傢伙，我會首先想到「哈哈，他今天頭髮不好。」我為什麼要嘲笑他來讓我自我感覺好一點呢？為什麼我要試著讓自己對自己的頭髮感覺好一點呢？因為我的頭髮要掉了，我擔心它會消失。我發現我90%的想法都是基於恐懼。另外10%可能是基於慾望。

You don』t make any decisions. You don』t judge anything. You just accept everything. If I do that for ten or fifteen minutes while walking around, I end up in a very peaceful, grateful state. Choiceless Awareness works well for me. [6]

你不能做任何決定。你不會評判任何事情。你只要接受一切就行了。如果我在四處走動時這樣做10到15分鐘，我最終會處於一種非常平靜和感激的狀態。沒有選擇的意識對我很有效。

You could also do transcendental meditation, which is where you』re using repetitive chanting to create a white noise in your head to bury your thoughts. Or, you can just very keenly and very alertly be aware of your thoughts as they happen. As you watch your thoughts, you realize how many of them are fear -based . The moment you recognize a fear, without even trying it goes away. After a while, your mind quiets.

你也可以做超然的冥想，在那裡你用重複的吟誦在你的腦海裡製造白噪音來掩埋你的思想。或者，當你的想法發生時，你可以非常敏銳和警覺地意識到它們。當你觀察自己的想法時，你會意識到其中有多少是基於恐懼的。當你意識到一種恐懼的那一刻，甚至沒有嘗試它就會消失。過了一會兒，你的頭腦就會平靜下來。

When your mind quiets, you stop taking everything around you for granted. You start to notice the details. You think, 「Wow, I live in such a beautiful place. It』s so great that I have clothes, and I can go to Starbucks and get a coffee anytime. Look at these people—each one has a perfectly valid and complete life going on in their own heads.」

當你的頭腦平靜下來時，你就不再認為你周圍的一切都是理所當然的。你開始注意到細節。你會想，「哇，我住在這麼漂亮的地方。我有衣服真是太棒了，而且我可以隨時去星巴克喝杯咖啡。看看這些人--每個人的頭腦里都有一個完美而完整的生活。「
It pops us out of the story we』re constantly telling ourselves. If you stop talking to yourself for even ten minutes, if you stop obsessing over your own story, you』ll realize we are really far up Maslow』s hierarchy of needs, and life is pretty good. [6]

它把我們從我們不斷告訴自己的故事中解脫出來。如果你停止自言自語，哪怕只有10分鐘，如果你不再糾結于自己的故事，你就會意識到，我們真的遠遠超出了馬斯洛的需求層次，生活是相當美好的。

Life -hack : When in bed, meditate. Either you will have a deep meditation or fall asleep. Victory either way.

生活黑客：躺在床上冥想。你要麼會沉思，要麼就會睡著。不管是哪種方式的勝利。

Another method I』ve learned is to just sit there and you close your eyes for at least one hour a day. You surrender to whatever happens—don』t make any effort whatsoever. You make no effort for something, and you make no effort against anything. If there are thoughts running through your mind, you let the thoughts run.

我學到的另一種方法就是坐在那裡，每天閉上眼睛至少一個小時。無論發生什麼，你都要投降--無論如何都不要做任何努力。你不為某事努力，也不為任何事努力。如果有想法在你的腦海中執行，你就讓這些想法執行。

For your entire life, things have been happening to you. Some good, some bad, most of which you have processed and dissolved, but a few stuck with you. Over time, more and more stuck with you, and they almost became like these barnacles stuck to you.

在你的一生中，事情一直發生在你身上。有些是好的，有些是壞的，大部分你已經處理並溶解了，但也有一些粘在了你身上。隨著時間的推移，越來越多的人粘在你身上，它們幾乎就像這些藤壺粘在你身上一樣。

You lost your childhood sense of wonder and of being present and happy. You lost your inner happiness because you built up this personality of unresolved pain, errors, fears, and desires that glommed onto you like a bunch of barnacles.

你失去了童年時的好奇心，失去了活在當下和快樂的感覺。你失去了內心的快樂，因為你建立了這種未解決的痛苦、錯誤、恐懼和慾望的人格，就像一群藤壺一樣壓在你身上。

How do you get those barnacles off you? What happens in meditation is you』re sitting there and not resisting your mind. These things will start bubbling up. It』s like a giant inbox of unanswered emails, going back to your childhood. They will come out one by one, and you will be forced to deal with them.

你是怎麼把那些藤壺弄下來的？冥想中發生的事情是你坐在那裡，而不是抗拒你的思想。這些東西會開始冒泡。它就像一個巨大的收件箱，裡面裝滿了未回覆的電子郵件，回到了你的童年。他們會一個接一個地出來，你將被迫與他們打交道。

You will be forced to resolve them. Resolving them doesn』t take any work—you just observe them. Now you』re an adult with some distance, time, and space from previous events, and you can just resolve them. You can be much more objective about how you view them.

你將被迫解決這些問題。解決它們不需要任何工作-您只需觀察它們。現在你是成年人了，與以前的事件有一定的距離、時間和空間，你可以直接解決它們。你可以更加客觀地看待它們。

Over time, you will resolve a lot of these deep -seated unresolved things you have in your mind. Once they』re resolved, there will come a day when you sit down to meditate, and you』ll hit a mental 「inbox zero.」 When you open your mental 「email」 and there are none, that is a pretty amazing feeling.

隨著時間的推移，你會解決很多你腦海中這些深層次的懸而未決的事情。一旦這些問題得到解決，總有一天你會坐下來冥想，然後你的腦海中就會出現「收件箱為零」的情況。當你打開你腦海中的「電子郵件」，卻什麼也沒有，那是一種非常令人驚奇的感覺。

It』s a state of joy and bliss and peace. Once you have it, you don』t want to give it up. If you can get a free hour of bliss every morning just by sitting and closing your eyes, that is worth its weight in gold. It will change your life.

這是一種歡樂、幸福和和平的狀態。一旦你擁有了它，你就不會想放棄它。如果你每天早上只需坐著閉上眼睛就能得到一小時的空閑時間，那就是價值不菲的黃金。它會改變你的生活。

I recommend meditating one hour each morning because anything less is not enough time to really get deep into it. I would recommend if you really want to try meditation, try sixty days of one hour a day, first thing in the morning. After about sixty days, you will be tired of listening to your own mind. You will have resolved a lot of issues, or you have heard them enough to see through those fears and issues.

我建議每天早上冥想一個小時，因為任何少一點的時間都不足以真正深入冥想。如果你真的想嘗試冥想，我建議你嘗試六十天，每天一小時，早上第一件事。大約六十天後，你會厭倦傾聽自己的想法。你將已經解決了很多問題，或者你已經聽到了足夠多的東西來看穿那些恐懼和問題。

Meditation isn』t hard. All you have to do is sit there and do nothing. Just sit down. Close your eyes and say, 「I』m just going to give myself a break for an hour. This is my hour off from life. This is the hour I』m not going to do anything.

冥想並不難。你所要做的就是坐在那裡什麼也不做。坐下來就行了。閉上眼睛說，「我要讓自己休息一個小時。這是我離開生活的一小時。現在是我什麼都不會做的時候了。

「If thoughts come, thoughts come. I』m not going to fight them. I』m not going to embrace them. I』m not going to think harder about them. I』m not going to reject them. I』m just going to sit here for an hour with my eyes closed, and I』m going to do nothing.」 How hard is that? Why can you not do anything for an hour? What』s so hard about giving yourself an hour -long break? [74]

「如果思想來了，思想就來了。我不會和他們戰鬥的。我不會擁抱他們的。我不會再多想他們了。我不會拒絕他們的。我就在這裡閉著眼睛坐一個小時，什麼也不做。「這有多難？你為什麼一個小時都不能做點什麼呢？給自己一個小時的休息有什麼難的？[74]

Was there a moment you realized you could control how you interpreted things? I think one problem people have is not recognizing they can control how they interpret and respond to a situation.

有沒有那麼一刻，你意識到你可以控制自己對事物的解讀？我認為人們存在的一個問題是沒有認識到他們可以控制自己如何解釋和應對一種情況。

I think everyone knows it』s possible. There』s a great Osho lecture, titled 「The Attraction for Drugs Is Spiritual.」 He talks about why do people do drugs (everything from alcohol to psychedelics to cannabis). They』re doing it to control their mental state. They』re doing it to control how they react. Some people drink because it helps them not care as much, or they』re potheads because they can zone out, or they do psychedelics to feel very present or connected to nature. The attraction of drugs is spiritual.

我想每個人都知道這是可能的。有一個很棒的Osho講座，題目是「毒品的吸引力是精神的。」他談到人們為什麼吸毒(從酒精到迷幻劑再到大麻)。他們這樣做是爲了控制自己的精神狀態。他們這麼做是爲了控制自己的反應。有些人喝酒是因為這可以幫助他們不那麼在意，或者他們是癮君子因為他們可以神志不清，或者他們做迷幻劑是爲了感覺到非常在場或與自然聯繫在一起。毒品的吸引力是精神上的。

All of society does this to some extent. People chasing thrills in action sports or flow states or orgasms—any of these states people strive for are people trying to get out of their own heads. They』re trying to get away from the voice in their heads—the overdeveloped sense of self.

所有的社會都在某種程度上做到了這一點。人們在動作、運動、心流狀態或高潮中追逐刺激--人們所追求的這些狀態中的任何一種都是試圖跳出自己的頭腦的人。他們試圖擺脫頭腦中的聲音--過度發展的自我意識。

At the very least, I do not want my sense of self to continue to develop and strengthen as I get older. I want it to be weaker and more muted so I can be more in present everyday reality, accept nature and the world for what it is, and appreciate it very much as a child would. [4]

至少，我不想讓我的自我意識隨著年齡的增長而繼續發展和加強。我想要它變得更弱、更安靜，這樣我就可以更多地處於現在的日常現實中，接受自然和世界的本來面目，像孩子一樣欣賞它。

The first thing to realize is you can observe your mental state. Meditation doesn』t mean you』re suddenly going to gain the superpower to control your internal state. The advantage of meditation is recognizing just how out of control your mind is. It is like a monkey flinging feces, running around the room, making trouble, shouting, and breaking things. It』s completely uncontrollable. It』s an out -of -control madperson.

首先要意識到的是，你可以觀察自己的精神狀態。冥想並不意味著你會突然獲得控制內心狀態的超能力。冥想的好處是認識到你的思想是多麼的失控。它就像一隻猴子扔糞便，在房間里跑來跑去，搗亂，叫喊，打碎東西。這是完全無法控制的。這是個失控的瘋子。

You have to see this mad creature in operation before you feel a certain distaste toward it and start separating yourself from it. In that separation is liberation. You realize, 「Oh, I don』t want to be that person. Why am I so out of control?」 Awareness alone calms you down. [4]

你必須看到這個瘋狂的生物在運作，然後你才會對它產生某種反感，並開始與它分離。在這種分離中，就是解放。你會意識到，「哦，我不想成為那樣的人。為什麼我會這麼失控？「意識本身就能讓你平靜下來。

Insight meditation lets you run your brain in debug mode until you realize you』re just a subroutine in a larger program.

洞察力冥想讓你在除錯模式下執行你的大腦，直到你意識到你只是一個更大程式中的一個子例程。

I try to keep an eye on my internal monologue. It doesn』t always work. In the computer programming sense, I try to run my brain in 「debugging mode」 as much as possible. When I』m talking to someone, or when I』m engaged in a group activity, it』s almost impossible because your brain has too many things to handle. If I』m by myself, like just this morning, I』m brushing my teeth and I start thinking forward to a podcast. I started going through this little fantasy where I imagined Shane asking me a bunch of questions and I was fantasy - answering them. Then, I caught myself. I put my brain in debug mode and just watched every little instruction go by.

我試著注意我內心的獨白。它並不總是有效的。在計算機程式設計的意義上，我儘量讓我的大腦執行在「除錯模式」中。當我和某人交談時，或者當我參與小組活動時，這幾乎是不可能的，因為你的大腦有太多的事情要處理。如果我一個人，就像今天早上一樣，我在刷牙，我開始想著播客。我開始經歷這個小小的幻想，我想像謝恩問了我一堆問題，我幻想著回答這些問題。然後，我突然發現自己。我把我的大腦置於除錯模式，只是看著每一條小指令流逝。

I said, 「Why am I fantasy -future planning? Why can』t I just stand here and brush my teeth?」 It』s the awareness my brain was running off in the future and planning some fantasy scenario out of ego. I was like, 「Well, do I really care if I embarrass myself? Who cares? I』m going to die anyway. This is all going to go to zero, and I won』t remember anything, so this is pointless.」


我說，「我為什麼要幻想未來的計劃？為什麼我不能站在這裡刷牙呢？「這是一種意識，我的大腦在未來失去了知覺，出於自我而計劃著一些幻想的場景。我就想，「好吧，我真的在乎我會不會讓自己難堪？誰在乎啊？反正我都要死了。這一切都會歸零，我什麼都不會記得，所以這是毫無意義的。「

Then, I shut down, and I went back to brushing my teeth. I was noticing how good the toothbrush was and how good it felt. Then the next moment, I』m off to thinking something else. I have to look at my brain again and say, 「Do I really need to solve this problem right now?」


然後，我就關機了，我又回去刷牙了。我注意到牙刷有多好，手感也有多好。然後下一刻，我就開始想別的事情了。我不得不再看一
眼我的大腦，然後說，「我真的需要現在就解決這個問題嗎？」


Ninety -five percent of what my brain runs off and tries to do, I don』t need to tackle in that exact moment. If the brain is like a muscle, I』ll be better off resting it, being at peace. When a particular problem arises, I』ll immerse myself in it.

我大腦中95%的事情都在流逝並試圖去做，我不需要在那個時刻去處理。如果大腦像一塊肌肉，我最好讓它休息，平靜下來。當一個特別的問題出現時，我會全身心地投入其中。

Right now as we』re talking, I』d rather dedicate myself to being completely lost in the conversation and to being 100 percent focused on this as opposed to thinking about 「Oh, when I brushed my teeth, did I do it the right way?」

現在我們談話的時候，我寧願完全沉浸在談話中，百分之百地專注于這件事，而不是想「哦，當我刷牙的時候，我做得對嗎？」

The ability to singularly focus is related to the ability to lose yourself and be present, happy, and (ironically) more effective. [4]

集中注意力的能力與迷失自我、活在當下、快樂和(具有諷刺意味的)更有效率的能力有關。

It』s almost like you』re taking yourself out of a certain frame and you』re watching things from a different perspective even though you』re in your own mind.

這幾乎就像是你把自己從某個特定的畫面中帶出來，你從一個不同的角度看事情，即使你在你自己的頭腦里。

Buddhists talk about awareness versus the ego. They』re really talking about how you can think of your brain, your consciousness, as a multilayered mechanism. There』s a core -base , kernel -level OS running. Then, there are applications running on top. (I like to think of it as computer and geek speak.)
佛教徒談論覺知與自我。他們實際上是在談論如何將你的大腦、你的意識看作一個多層次的機制。有一個基於內核的內核級操作系統在執行。然後，有一些應用程式在上面執行。(我喜歡把它想像成電腦和極客的語言。)
I』m actually going back to my awareness level of OS, which is always calm, always peaceful, and generally happy and content. I』m trying to stay in awareness mode and not activate the monkey mind, which is always worried, frightened, and anxious. It serves incredible purpose, but I try not to activate the monkey mind until I need it. When I need it, I want to just focus on that. If I run it 24/7, I waste energy and the monkey mind becomes me. I am more than my monkey mind.

我實際上是回到了我對操作系統的認知水平，它總是平靜的，總是和平的，總體上是快樂和滿足的。我試著保持清醒狀態，而不是啟用猴子的思維，它總是擔心、害怕和焦慮。它有令人難以置信的目的，但我試著不啟用猴子的大腦，直到我需要它。當我需要它的時候，我只想專注於它。如果我全天候執行它，我就浪費了能量，猴子的頭腦就變成了我。我不僅僅是我的猴心。

Another thing: spirituality, religion, Buddhism, or anything you follow will teach you over time you are more than just your mind. You are more than just your habits. You are more than just your preferences. You』re a level of awareness. You』re a body. Modern humans, we don』t live enough in our bodies. We don』t live enough in our awareness. We live too much in this internal monologue in our heads. All of which is just programmed into you by society and by the environment when you were younger.

另一件事：靈性、宗教、佛教或你遵循的任何東西，隨著時間的推移會教會你，你不僅僅是你的頭腦。你不僅僅是你的習慣。你不僅僅是你的喜好。你是某種程度的意識。你是一具身體。現代人，我們在我們的身體里活得不夠。我們在意識中活得不夠。我們在頭腦中的這種內心獨白中活得太多了。當你年輕的時候，所有這些都是社會和環境編入你體內的。

You are basically a bunch of DNA that reacted to environmental effects when you were younger. You recorded the good and bad experiences, and you use them to prejudge everything thrown against you. Then you』re using those experiences, constantly trying and predict and change the future.

你基本上是一群在你年輕時對環境影響做出反應的DNA。你記錄下了好的和不好的經歷，並用它們來預判任何對你不利的事情。然後你就會利用這些經驗，不斷地嘗試、預測和改變未來。

As you get older, the sum of preferences you』ve accumulated is very, very large. These habitual reactions end up as runaway freight trains controlling your mood. We should control our own moods. Why don』t we study how to control our moods? What a masterful thing it would be if you could say, 「Right now I would like to be in the curious state,」 and then you can genuinely get yourself into the curious state. Or say, 「I want to be in a mourning state. I』m mourning a loved one, and I want to grieve for them. I really want to feel that. I don』t want to be distracted by a computer programming problem due tomorrow.」

隨著年齡的增長，你積累的偏好總和會非常非常大。這些習慣性反應最終會變成失控的貨運列車控制你的情緒。我們應該控制自己的情緒。我們為什麼不研究一下如何控制自己的情緒呢？如果你能說，「現在我想要處於好奇的狀態」，然後你就能真正地讓自己進入好奇的狀態，那將是一件多麼高超的事情。或者說，「我想處於哀悼狀態。我在哀悼我所愛的人，我想為他們哀悼。我真的很想感受一下。我不想因為明天要出的電腦程式設計問題而分心。「

The mind itself is a muscle—it can be trained and conditioned. It has been haphazardly conditioned by society to be out of our control. If you look at your mind with awareness and intent (a 24/7 job you』re working at every moment) I think you can unpack your own mind, your emotions, thoughts, and reactions. Then you can start reconfiguring. You can start rewriting this program to what you want. [4]

頭腦本身就是一塊肌肉--它可以被訓練和調節。它已經被社會隨意地規定為不受我們的控制。如果你用意識和意圖來看待你的頭腦(一份24/7全天候的工作，你每時每刻都在工作)，我認為你可以解開你自己的頭腦，你的情緒，你的想法，和你的反應。然後您可以開始重新配置。您可以開始將此程式重寫為您想要的內容。

Meditation is turning off society and listening to yourself.
