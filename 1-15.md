# How to Think Clearly

如何清晰地思考

「Clear thinker」 is a better compliment than 「smart.」
「清晰的思考者」比「聰明」是更好的讚美。

Real knowledge is intrinsic, and it』s built from the ground up. To use a math example, you can』t understand trigonometry without understanding arithmetic and geometry. Basically, if someone is using a lot of fancy words and a lot of big concepts, they probably don』t know what they』re talking about. I think the smartest people can explain things to a child. If you can』t explain it to a child, then you don』t know it. It』s a common saying and it』s very true.

真正的知識是內在的，它是從頭開始建立起來的。舉個數學例子，如果不懂算術和幾何，你就無法理解三角學。基本上，如果有人使用了很多花哨的詞彙和大量的大概念，他們可能不知道自己在說什麼。我認為最聰明的人可以向孩子解釋事情。如果你不能向孩子解釋，那你就不知道。這是一句俗語，也是非常正確的。

Richard Feynman very famously does this in 「Six Easy Pieces,」 one of his early physics lectures. He basically explains mathematics in three pages. He starts from the number line—counting—and then he goes all the way up to precalculus. He just builds it up through an unbroken chain of logic. He doesn』t rely on any definitions.

理查德·費曼(Richard Feynman)在他早期的物理講座之一的「六個簡單的片段」中非常著名地做到了這一點。他基本上用了三頁紙來解釋數學。他從數行計數開始，然後一直到微積分預科。他只是通過一個不間斷的邏輯鏈來建立它。他不依賴任何定義。

The really smart thinkers are clear thinkers. They understand the basics at a very, very fundamental level. I would rather understand the basics really well than memorize all kinds of complicated concepts I can』t stitch together and can』t rederive from the basics. If you can』t rederive concepts from the basics as you need them, you』re lost. You』re just memorizing. [4]

真正聰明的思想家是頭腦清晰的思想家。他們在非常、非常基礎的層面上理解基礎知識。我寧願很好地理解基礎知識，也不願記住各種複雜的概念，這些概念我不能拼湊在一起，也不能從基礎知識中重新推導出來。如果您不能根據需要從基本概念中重新派生出概念，那麼您就失敗了。你只是在死記硬背。

The advanced concepts in a field are less proven. We use them to signal insider knowledge, but we』d be better off nailing the basics. [11]
某一領域的高級概念較少得到驗證。我們用它們來傳遞內幕訊息，但我們最好還是把基本知識釘牢。

Clear thinkers appeal to their own authority.
頭腦清晰的人求助於他們自己的權威。

Part of making effective decisions boils down to dealing with reality. How do you make sure you』re dealing with reality when you』re making decisions?
做出有效決策的一部分可以歸結為面對現實。當你做決定時，你如何確保你面對的是現實？
By not having a strong sense of self or judgments or mind presence. The 「monkey mind」 will always respond with this regurgitated emotional response to what it thinks the world should be. Those desires will cloud your reality. This happens a lot of times when people are mixing politics and business.

沒有強烈的自我意識、判斷力或者精神狀態。「猴心」總是會以這種反胃的情緒反應來回應它認為的世界應該是什麼樣子。這些慾望會讓你的現實蒙上陰影。當人們把政治和商業混為一談時，這種情況經常發生。

The number one thing clouding us from being able to see reality is we have preconceived notions of the way it should be.

阻礙我們看清現實的第一件事是我們對它應該是什麼樣子有先入為主的觀念。

One definition of a moment of suffering is 「the moment when you see things exactly the way they are.」 This whole time, you』ve been convinced your business is doing great, and really, you』ve ignored the signs it』s not doing well. Then, your business fails, and you suffer because you』ve been putting off reality. You』ve been hiding it from yourself.

痛苦時刻的一個定義是「你看到事物的本來面目的那一刻」。一直以來，你都確信你的生意做得很好，而實際上，你忽略了它做得不好的跡象。然後，你的生意失敗了，你遭受了痛苦，因為你一直在拖延現實。你一直在瞞著自己。

The good news is, the moment of suffering—when you』re in pain—is a moment of truth. It is a moment where you』re forced to embrace reality the way it actually is. Then, you can make meaningful change and progress. You can only make progress when you』re starting with the truth.
好訊息是，當你處於痛苦中時，痛苦的時刻就是真相的時刻。這是一個你被迫接受現實的時刻。然後，你才能做出有意義的改變和進步。只有從真相出發，你才能取得進步。

The hard thing is seeing the truth. To see the truth, you have to get your ego out of the way because your ego doesn』t want to face the truth. The smaller you can make your ego, the less conditioned you can make your reactions, the less desires you can have about the outcome you want, the easier it will be to see the reality.

最難的是看到真相。要看清真相，你必須把你的自負放在一邊，因為你的自負不想面對真相。你的自我越小，你的反應就越不受約束，你對你想要的結果的慾望就越少，就越容易看到現實。

What we wish to be true clouds our perception of what is true. Suffering is the moment when we can no longer deny reality.

我們希望成為真實的東西模糊了我們對真實的認知。苦難是我們不能再否認現實的時刻。

Imagine we』re going through something difficult like a breakup, a job loss, a business failure, or a health problem, and our friends are advising us. When we』re advising them, the answer is obvious. It comes to us in a minute, and we tell them exactly, 「Oh that girl, get over her, she wasn』t good for you anyway. You』ll be happier. Trust me. You』ll find someone.」

想像一下，我們正在經歷一些困難的事情，比如分手、失業、生意失敗或健康問題，我們的朋友都在建議我們。當我們建議他們時，答案是顯而易見的。它立刻出現在我們面前，我們準確地告訴他們，「哦，那個女孩，忘了她吧，反正她對你不好。你會更開心的。請相信我。你會找到另一個人的。「

You know the correct answer, but your friend can』t see it, because they』re in the moment of suffering and pain. They』re still wishing reality was different. The problem isn』t reality. The problem is their desire is colliding with reality and preventing them from seeing the truth, no matter how much you say it. The same thing happens when I make decisions.

你知道正確的答案，但是你的朋友看不到，因為他們正處於痛苦和痛苦的時刻。他們仍然希望現實是不同的。問題不是現實。問題是，無論你說多少，他們的願望都在與現實發生衝突，阻止他們看到真相。當我做決定時，同樣的事情也會發生。

The more desire I have for something to work out a certain way, the less likely I am to see the truth. Especially in business, if something isn』t going well, I try to acknowledge it publicly and I try to acknowledge it publicly in front of my co -founders and friends and co -workers . Then, I』m not hiding it from anybody else. If I』m not hiding it from anybody, I』m not going to delude myself from what』s actually going on. [4]

我越是渴望某件事以某種方式解決，我就越不可能看到真相。特別是在商業上，如果事情進展不順利，我會試著公開承認，也會試著在我的聯合創始人、朋友和同事面前公開承認。那我就不會對任何人隱瞞了。如果我沒有對任何人隱瞞，我就不會從實際發生的事情中欺騙自己。

What you feel tells you nothing about the facts—it merely tells you something about your estimate of the facts.

你的感覺並沒有告訴你任何關於事實的事情--它只告訴你一些關於你對事實的估計。

It』s actually really important to have empty space. If you don』t have a day or two every week in your calendar where you』re not always in meetings, and you』re not always busy, then you』re not going to be able to think.

事實上，擁有空白的空間真的很重要。如果你的日曆上每週沒有一兩天你不總是在開會，而且你也不總是很忙，那麼你將無法思考。

You』re not going to be able to have good ideas for your business. You』re not going to be able to make good judgments. I also encourage taking at least one day a week (preferably two, because if you budget two, you』ll end up with one) where you just have time to think.

你將不能為你的企業提出好的想法。你將不能做出正確的判斷。我還鼓勵每週至少花一天時間(最好是兩天，因為如果你預算兩天，最後只有一天)，這樣你就有時間思考了。

It』s only after you』re bored you have the great ideas. It』s never going to be when you』re stressed, or busy, running around or rushed. Make the time. [7]

只有在你厭倦之後，你才會有好主意。當你壓力很大、很忙、四處奔跑或匆忙時，你永遠不會有這樣的感覺。騰出時間來。「[7]

Very smart people tend to be weird since they insist on thinking everything through for themselves.

非常聰明的人往往很怪異，因為他們堅持自己想清楚每件事。

A contrarian isn』t one who always objects—that』s a conformist of a different sort. A contrarian reasons independently from the ground up and resists pressure to conform.

逆向投資者不是總是反對的人--那是一種不同型別的墨守成規的人。逆向投資者從根本上獨立地進行推理，並頂住要求順從的壓力。

Cynicism is easy. Mimicry is easy.
Optimistic contrarians are the rarest breed.

憤世嫉俗是很容易的。模仿很容易，
樂觀的逆向投資者是最稀有的品種。
