# Prioritize and Focus

確定優先順序和重點

I』ve encountered plenty of bad luck along the way. The first little fortune I made I instantly lost in the stock market. The second little fortune I made, or should have made, I basically got cheated out of by my business partners. It』s only the third time around that has been a charm.

我一路上遇到了很多厄運。我賺到的第一筆小財富馬上就輸在了股票市場上。我賺的或者應該賺的第二小筆錢，基本上被我的商業夥伴騙走了。這已經是第三次了，這是一種魅力。

Even then, it has been a slow and steady struggle. I haven』t made money in my life in one giant payout. It has always been a whole bunch of small things piling up. It』s more about consistently creating wealth by creating businesses, creating opportunities, and creating investments. It hasn』t been a giant one -off thing. My personal wealth has not been generated by one big year. It just stacks up a little bit, a few chips at a time: more options, more businesses, more investments, more things I can do.

即便如此，這也是一場緩慢而穩定的鬥爭。我這輩子還沒有在一次巨額支出中賺過錢。它總是一大堆小東西堆積在一起。它更多的是通過創造商業、創造機會和創造投資來持續創造財富。這並不是一件巨大的一次性的事情。我的個人財富不是靠一個大年份創造出來的。它只是堆積了一點，一次幾個晶片：更多的選擇，更多的業務，更多的投資，更多的事情我可以做。

Thanks to the internet, opportunities are massively abundant. In fact, I have too many ways to make money. I don』t have enough time. I literally have opportunities pouring out of my ears, and I keep running out of time. There are so many ways to create wealth, to create products, to create businesses, and to get paid by society as a byproduct. I just can』t handle them all. [78]
多虧了網際網路，機會非常豐富。事實上，我有太多賺錢的方法。我沒有足夠的時間。我真的有大量的機會從我的耳朵里涌出，而我一直在耗盡時間。有很多方法可以創造財富，創造產品，創造企業，並作為副產品獲得社會的報酬。我就是處理不了所有的問題。

Value your time at an hourly rate, and ruthlessly spend to save time at that rate. You will never be worth more than you think you』re worth.

以小時計價珍惜你的時間，並毫不留情地花在這個速度上來節省時間。你的價值永遠不會超過你認為自己的價值。

No one is going to value you more than you value yourself. You just have to set a very high personal hourly rate and you have to stick to it. Even when I was young, I just decided I was worth a lot more than the market thought I was worth, and I started treating myself that way.

沒有人會比你更看重你自己。你只需要設定一個非常高的個人時薪，而且你必須堅持下去。甚至在我年輕的時候，我就認為我的價值比市場認為的要高得多，我開始這樣對待自己。

Always factor your time into every decision. How much time does it take? It』s going to take you an hour to get across town to get something. If you value yourself at one hundred dollars an hour, that』s basically throwing one hundred dollars out of your pocket. Are you going to do that? [78]

每一個決定都要考慮到你的時間因素。需要多長時間？你要花一個小時穿過鎮子去買點東西。如果你對自己的估值是每小時100美元，那基本上就是從你的口袋裡掏出100美元。你要做那件事嗎？[78]

Fast -forward to your wealthy self and pick some intermediate hourly rate. For me, believe it or not, back when you could have hired me…Which now obviously you can』t, but back when you could have hired me…this was true a decade ago or even two decades ago, before I had any real money. My hourly rate, I used to say to myself over and over, is $5,000 an hour. Today when I look back, really it was about $1,000 an hour.

快進到你富有的自己，選擇一些中間的時薪。對我來說，信不信由你，回到你可以雇我的時候，…現在很明顯你不能，但是回到你可以雇我的時候，…十年前，甚至二十年前，在我還沒有真正的錢之前，這是真的。我過去一遍又一遍地對自己說，我的時薪是每小時5000美元。今天當我回頭看的時候，真的是每小時1000美元左右。

Of course, I still ended up doing stupid things like arguing with the electrician or returning the broken speaker, but I shouldn』t have, and I did a lot less than any of my friends would. I would make a theatrical show out of throwing something in the trash pile or giving it to Salvation Army rather than trying to return it or handing something to people rather than trying to fix it.

當然，我最終還是做了一些愚蠢的事情，比如和電工吵架，或者把壞掉的揚聲器退回，但我不應該這樣做，而且我做的事情比我的任何朋友都要少得多。我會把一些東西扔進垃圾堆，或者把它送給救世軍，而不是試圖把它歸還，或者把東西遞給人們，而不是試圖修復它，這是一場戲劇表演。

I would argue with my girlfriends, and even today it』s my wife, 「I don』t do that. That』s not a problem that I solve.」 I still argue that with my mother when she hands me little to -do 』s. I just don』t do that. I would rather hire you an assistant. This was true even when I didn』t have money. [78]

我會和我的女朋友爭執，即使在今天也是我的妻子，「我不會那樣做。這不是我能解決的問題。「當我母親給我一些待辦事項時，我仍然會和她爭論這一點。我只是不會那麼做。我寧願給你雇個助理。即使在我沒有錢的時候，這也是真的。「[78]

Another way of thinking about something is, if you can outsource something or not do something for less than your hourly rate, outsource it or don』t do it. If you can hire someone to do it for less than your hourly rate, hire them. That even includes things like cooking. You may want to eat your healthy home cooked meals, but if you can outsource it, do that instead. [78]

思考某事的另一種方式是，如果你能以低於時薪的價格外包某事或不做某事，那就外包或不做。如果你可以僱傭比你的時薪更低的人來做這件事，那就僱傭他們吧。這甚至包括像做飯這樣的事情。你可能想吃健康的家常菜，但如果你能外包，那就這麼做吧。

Set a very high hourly aspirational rate for yourself and stick to it. It should seem and feel absurdly high. If it doesn』t, it』s not high enough. Whatever you picked, my advice to you would be to raise it. Like I said, for myself, even before I had money, for the longest time I used $5,000 an hour. And if you extrapolate that out into what it looks like as an annual salary, it』s multiple millions of dollars per year.

為自己設定一個非常高的每小時渴望速率，並堅持下去。它應該看起來和感覺上高得離譜。如果不是，那就是不夠高。不管你選什麼，我給你的建議是提高它。就像我說的，對我自己來說，甚至在我還沒有錢之前，我就用了每小時5000美元，這是最長的一次。如果你把它外推到看起來像是年薪的地方，那就是每年幾百萬美元。

Ironically, I actually think I』ve beaten it. I』m not the hardest working person—I』m actually a lazy person. I work through bursts of energy where I』m really motivated with something. If I actually look at how much I』ve earned per actual hour that I』ve put in, it』s probably quite a bit higher than that. [78]

具有諷刺意味的是，我真的認為我打敗了它。我不是最勤奮的人--我實際上是個懶人。我在精力迸發的情況下工作，在那裡我真的是有動力的。如果我真的看看我每實際投入一小時賺了多少錢，可能會比這個數字高出很多。「[78]

Can you expand on your statement, 「If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you」?

你能再詳述一下你的說法嗎？「如果你暗地裡鄙視財富，它就會躲避你」。

If you get into a relative mindset, you』re always going to hate people who do better than you, you』re always going to be jealous or envious of them. They』ll sense those feelings when you try and do business with them. When you try and do business with somebody, if you have any bad thoughts or any judgments about them, they will feel it. Humans are wired to feel what the other person deep down inside feels. You have to get out of a relative mindset. [10]

如果你進入一種相對的心態，你總是會憎恨比你做得更好的人，你總是會嫉妒或羨慕他們。當你試著和他們做生意時，他們會感覺到這種感覺。當你試圖與某人做生意時，如果你對他們有任何不好的想法或判斷，他們會感覺到的。人類與生俱來就能感受到他人內心深處的感受。你必須走出相對的思維定勢。

Literally, being anti -wealth will prevent you from becoming wealthy, because you will not have the right mindset for it, you won』t have the right spirit, and you won』t be dealing with people on the right level. Be optimistic, be positive. It』s important. Optimists actually do better in the long run. [10]

從字面上看，反財富會阻止你變得富有，因為你不會有正確的心態，你不會有正確的精神，你也不會在正確的層面上與人打交道。要樂觀，要積極。這很重要。從長遠來看，樂觀主義者實際上做得更好。

The business world has many people playing zero sum games and a few playing positive sum games searching for each other in the crowd.

商界有很多人玩零和遊戲，少數人玩正和遊戲，在人群中互相尋找。

There are fundamentally two huge games in life that people play. One is the money game. Because money is not going to solve all of your problems, but it』s going to solve all of your money problems. People realize that, so they want to make money.

從根本上說，人們生活中有兩個巨大的遊戲可玩。一個是金錢遊戲。因為錢不會解決你所有的問題，但它會解決你所有的錢問題。人們意識到了這一點，所以他們想賺錢。

But at the same time, many of them, deep down, believe they can』t make money. They don』t want any wealth creation to happen. So, they attack the whole enterprise by saying, 「Well, making money is evil. You shouldn』t do it.」

但與此同時，他們中的許多人在內心深處認為自己賺不到錢。他們不希望任何財富創造發生。因此，他們攻擊整個企業說，「嗯，賺錢是邪惡的。你不應該這麼做。「

But they』re actually playing the other game, which is the status game. They』re trying to be high status in the eyes of other people watching by saying, 「Well, I don』t need money. We don』t want money.」 Status is your ranking in the social hierarchy. [78]

但他們實際上在玩另一個遊戲，那就是狀態遊戲。他們試圖通過說「嗯，我不需要錢」來在其他人的眼裡保持較高的地位。我們不要錢。「地位是你在社會等級中的排名。

Wealth creation is an evolutionarily recent positive -sum game. Status is an old zero -sum game. Those attacking wealth creation are often just seeking status.

財富創造是一種進化上最近的正和遊戲。地位是一個古老的零和遊戲。那些攻擊財富創造的人往往只是爲了尋求地位。

Status is a zero -sum game. It』s a very old game. We』ve been playing it since monkey tribes. It』s hierarchical. Who』s number one? Who』s number two? Who』s number three? And for number three to move to number two, number two has to move out of that slot. So, status is a zero -sum game.

地位是一個零和遊戲。這是一個非常古老的遊戲。我們從猴子部落就開始玩了。這是分等級的。誰是第一名？誰是第二名？誰是三號？爲了讓三號移動到二號，二號必須移出那個位置。所以，地位是一個零和遊戲。

Politics is an example of a status game. Even sports are an example of a status game. To be the winner, there must be a loser. I don』t fundamentally love status games. They play an important role in our society, so we can figure out who』s in charge. But fundamentally, you play them because they』re a necessary evil. [78]

政治是地位遊戲的一個例子。即使是體育運動也是地位遊戲的一個例子。要想成為贏家，就必須有失敗者。我根本不喜歡狀態遊戲。他們在我們的社會中扮演著重要的角色，所以我們可以弄清楚誰是負責人。但從根本上說，你玩弄它們是因為它們是一種必要的邪惡。

The problem is, to win at a status game, you have to put somebody else down. That』s why you should avoid status games in your life—they make you into an angry, combative person. You』re always fighting to put other people down, to put yourself and the people you like up.

問題是，要想在狀態遊戲中取勝，你必須擊倒別人。這就是為什麼你應該避免在你的生活中玩狀態遊戲--它們會讓你變成一個憤怒、好鬥的人。你總是努力貶低別人，貶低你自己和你喜歡的人。

Status games are always going to exist. There』s no way around it, but realize most of the time, when you』re trying to create wealth and you』re getting attacked by someone else, they』re trying to increase their own status at your expense. They』re playing a different game. And it』s a worse game. It』s a zero -sum game instead of a positive -sum game. [78]

地位遊戲總是會存在的。這是別無選擇的，但你要意識到，大多數時候，當你試圖創造財富，而你卻受到別人的攻擊時，他們是在試圖以犧牲你為代價來提高自己的地位。他們在玩不同的遊戲。這是一場更糟糕的比賽。這是一個零和遊戲，而不是正和遊戲。

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

玩愚蠢的遊戲，贏得愚蠢的獎品。

What is the most important thing to do for younger people starting out?
對於開始創業的年輕人來說，最重要的事情是什麼？
Spend more time making the big decisions. There are basically three really big decisions you make in your early life: where you live, who you』re with, and what you do.

花更多的時間做重大決定。在你的早期生活中，基本上有三個真正重大的決定：你住在哪裡，你和誰在一起，以及你做什麼。

We spend very little time deciding which relationship to get into. We spend so much time in a job, but we spend so little time deciding which job to get into. Choosing what city to live in can almost completely determine the trajectory of your life, but we spend so little time trying to figure out what city to live in.

我們花很少的時間來決定要建立哪種關係。我們在一份工作上花費了如此多的時間，但我們花在決定從事哪一份工作上的時間卻如此之少。選擇住在哪個城市幾乎可以完全決定你的生活軌跡，但我們花在試圖弄清楚住在哪個城市上的時間太少了。

Advice to a young engineer considering moving to San Francisco: 「Do you want to leave your friends behind? Or be the one left behind?」
給一位考慮搬到舊金山的年輕工程師的建議：「你想把你的朋友留在後面嗎？還是那個落在後面的人？「
If you』re going to live in a city for ten years, if you』re going to be in a job for five years, if you』re in a relationship for a decade, you should be spending one to two years deciding these things. These are highly dominating decisions. Those three decisions really matter.

如果你要在一個城市生活十年，如果你要工作五年，如果你要談一段十年的戀愛，你應該花一到兩年的時間來決定這些事情。這些都是具有高度支配性的決定。這三個決定真的很重要。

You have to say no to everything and free up your time so you can solve the important problems. Those three are probably the three biggest ones. [1]

你必須對一切說不，騰出時間來解決重要的問題。這三個可能是最大的三個。

What are one or two steps you』d take to surround yourself with successful people?

要讓自己周圍都是成功人士，你會採取什麼一兩個步驟呢？

Figure out what you』re good at, and start helping other people with it. Give it away. Pay it forward. Karma works because people are consistent. On a long enough timescale, you will attract what you project. But don』t measure—your patience will run out if you count. [7]

找出你擅長什麼，然後開始幫助別人。送人吧。把它發揚光大。因果報應之所以有效，是因為人們是始終如一的。在足夠長的時間尺度上，你會吸引你所投射的東西。但是不要測量--如果你數一數，你的耐心就會耗盡。

An old boss once warned: 「You』ll never be rich since you』re obviously smart, and someone will always offer you a job that』s just good enough.」

一位老老闆曾警告說：「你永遠不會變得富有，因為你顯然很聰明，而且總會有人給你提供一份剛剛好的工作。」

How did you decide to start your first company?

你是如何決定創辦你的第一家公司的？

I was working at this tech company called @Home Network, and I told everybody around me—my boss, coworkers, my friends, 「In Silicon Valley, all of these other people are starting companies. It looks like they can do it. I』m going to start a company. I』m just here temporarily. I』m an entrepreneur.」

我在一家名為@Home Network的科技公司工作，我告訴我周圍的每個人--我的老闆、同事、朋友，「在硅谷，所有這些人都在創業。看起來他們能做到。我要開一家公司。我只是暫時來這裡。我是一名企業家。「

…I didn』t actually mean to trick myself into it. It wasn』t a deliberate, calculated thing.

…我並不是真的想騙自己去做這件事。這不是一件經過深思熟慮、經過深思熟慮的事情。

I was just venting, talking out loud, being overly honest. But I didn』t actually start a company. This was in 1996, it was a much scarier, more difficult proposition to start a company then. Sure enough, everyone started saying 「What are you still doing here? I thought you were leaving to start a company?」 and 「Wow, you』re still here…」 I was literally embarrassed into starting my own company. [5]

我只是在發泄，大聲說話，太誠實了。但實際上我並沒有開公司。那是在1996年，當時創辦一家公司是一個可怕得多、困難得多的提議。果然，每個人都開始說「你還在這裡做什麼？我還以為你要離開去開公司呢？「還有「哇，你還在這裡，…」我真的很尷尬，開了自己的公司。

Yes, I know some people aren』t necessarily ready to be entrepreneurs, but long -term , where did we come up with this idea the correct logical thing to do is for everybody to work for somebody else? It is a very hierarchical model. [14]

是的，我知道有些人不一定準備好成為企業家，但從長遠來看，我們是從哪裡想出這個想法的正確的合乎邏輯的事情是每個人都為別人工作？這是一個等級很高的模型。「[14]
